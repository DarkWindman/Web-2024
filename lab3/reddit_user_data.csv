eurovision,#Eurovision2025 season AMA wish list ✨,31,2024-05-31 13:08:33+00:00,"This year, with the help of the lovely r/eurovision mods, we invited all 37 artists to official AMAs in Malmö, as well as securing one with the legendary Ola Melzig!

Obviously we've no idea who'll be competing in Switzerland as yet, but is there anyone Eurovision-related or Eurovision-adjacent that you'd like us to track down for an AMA while it's relatively quiet?

eurovision,The second Eurovision Grand Final draw is happening here – LIVE!,253,2024-05-09 20:57:16+00:00,"After tonight’s Second Semi-Final, our final ten qualifying acts will each draw their place in the Grand Final on Saturday – will they be First Half, Second Half or Producer’s Choice?

Here’s the place to find out – we’ll be updating this megathread LIVE as it happens.

**SOME ADMIN:**

* Based on Tuesday night, we expect the draw to happen very quickly after the Second Semi-Final ends, i.e within 15-20 minutes. But this is a whole other day, so not guaranteed. There’ll be a TikTok video of the draw later, but this is the only place where you can find out what happens live.
* Also based on how it went on Tuesday, the qualifying acts will draw based on the order in which they performed. It’s REALLY quick - the whole thing will be over in about 10-15 minutes.
* There are three options each act could pull from the bowl – First Half, Second Half, or Producer’s Choice. That’s a new option for this year – it means the Producer gets to decide if they perform in the first or the second half.
* Once the draw is over, the producers will disappear into a room to decide on a Grand Final running order. We don’t get to watch that bit, but it will be announced via official Eurovision social channels and the website later tonight. How much later? Who knows. It takes as long as it takes.
* In the meantime, stay right here for the Second Semi-Final qualifiers’ draw – we’ll be in the room and updating this thread for every artist as we go.

**UPDATE #1**: Marina Satti from 🇬🇷 Greece has drawn FIRST HALF

**UPDATE #2:** Nemo from 🇨🇭Switzerland has drawn PRODUCER’S CHOICE

**UPDATE #3:** Kaleen from 🇦🇹 Austria has drawn SECOND HALF

**UPDATE #4:** LADANIVA from 🇦🇲Armenia have drawn PRODUCER’S CHOICE

**UPDATE #5**: Dons from 🇱🇻 Latvia has drawn PRODUCER’S CHOICE

**UPDATE #6**: Nutsa Buzaladze from 🇬🇪 Georgia has drawn PRODUCER’S CHOICE

**UPDATE #7**: 5MIINUST x Puuluup from 🇪🇪 Estonia have drawn PRODUCER’S CHOICE

**UPDATE #8**: Eden Golan from 🇮🇱 Israel has drawn PRODUCER’S CHOICE

**UPDATE #9**: Gåte from 🇳🇴 Norway have drawn SECOND HALF

**UPDATE #10:** Joost Klein from 🇳🇱 Netherlands has drawn PRODUCER’S CHOICE

&#x200B;

So that’s it – all the scrolls have been claimed, and now it’s time for the producers to disappear into a secret room and decide the Grand Final running order. We’re thinking it involves lots of sticky notes on a wall, like Rosa Linn’s bedroom.

Later on tonight, we’ll have the final running order – we can’t say exactly what time, but keep an eye on the official Eurovision website and social channels for an update. But not this one, because we’re going to bed. 

Thanks for checking in, and enjoy the show on Saturday!

Here’s the place to find out – we’ll be updating this megathread LIVE as it happens.

**SOME ADMIN:**

* Do we know exactly what time? No. Likely around midnight (ish) but it will happen when it happens.
* Do we know what order the acts will arrive in? Also no. But once they’ve all assembled, the draw usually happens pretty quickly.
* Should we explain Producer’s Choice again? Yes – for the first time this year, if the artist draws a blank slip from the glass bowl, it means the Producer gets to decide if they perform in the first or the second half of the Grand Final.
* Will we be watching in the room, poised to update the megathread for each artist the second we know? ABSOLUTELY YES, so keep refreshing.

Don’t go away…

**UPDATE #1**: Silia Kapsis from 🇨🇾 Cyprus has drawn SECOND HALF

**UPDATE #2**: TEYA DORA from 🇷🇸 Serbia has drawn PRODUCER’S CHOICE

**15:00 CEST: Välkommen!**

Hello everyone, and welcome back to the FINAL official Eurovision Live Blog of the season. It’s Day Six, and after a fun secondment to Malmö AMA central, we’re back in the arena for one more first rehearsal megathread.

It’s Big 5 and host nation day today, so lots to look forward to - rehearsal sneak peaks, photos, TikTok links, backstage happenings. All exclusively here, kicking off at 15:40 CEST. Don't go away!

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**15:10 CEST: Your daily reminder!**

No need to read this if you were here early in the week! But if not, some useful info:

**How rehearsals work:**

* Each country has half an hour to rehearse – that’s usually enough time to run through their performance three times.
* If there is any pyro (smoke, flames, fireworks) they will be rehearsed in the final run-through. So we’ll add that information at the end.
* Usually the costumes worn in the first rehearsal are the ones you’ll see in the Semi-Final – but not always (we’ve seen a couple of examples this week). We’ll try to share this info up front, but to be honest we don’t always know. Which leads us to…

**How the Live Blog works:**

* We are seeing all these performances for the first time, and usually have no idea in advance what to expect. So we watch the first run-through with the laptop closed, then try to describe something inherently visual in words that fans from all across the world can understand. It takes time, and when staging is complex it can take even more time. We always want to do the performances justice, so please be patient ❤️
* Likewise photos and TikTok clips take time – we want to pick the best. We’ll get them up as soon as we can.
* We are a digital content team of very talented writers, photographers, videographers and editors, but the ‘we’ of writing this liveblog is actually one person (hello, I’m Heidi, might do an AMA at some point?) -  so it can be hard to stay on top of your questions. Happy to be here, grateful for your support, please join in and we’ll try to keep up!

&#x200B;

**Rehearsal 1: United Kingdom - Olly Alexander - Dizzy**

First up today is the UK’s Olly Alexander, singing his song *Dizzy*. He’s a very well-known and long-established performer in the UK, as well as an award-winning actor.

Very helpfully, we received some staging notes from the UK delegation for this performance – here’s how they describe what we’re currently watching:

*Olly Alexander's Eurovision performance transports viewers into a post- apocalyptic dystopian boxing gym locker room, aboard a spaceship hurtling toward Earth through a black hole in 1985!*

We’re not making this up, we promise. Essentially there’s a big room set on stage, lined with dirty tiles and shower heads – this whole thing feels like a grittier version of George Michael’s *Outside*, so very much the vibe of the official video. Olly’s four male dancers are wearing (the bare minimum of) red boxing gear, and the camera angles keep changing so it feels like the room is rotating, backed by a spinning black hole graphics on the LED. It really does feel like they’re in a dirty locker room hurtling through space.

In short, it’s VERY ambitious and mind-blowing bit of staging, with a gym bag full of special effects that mean it only really comes to life on screen.

Also a note on the song arrangement – to our ears, there’s a new middle eight with extra strings, and the build to the final chorus is different.

🧨 PYRO UPDATE! Loads of sparks and fireworks at the end, which make it feels like the set is malfunctioning, then a final big bang. Photos coming soon!

&#x200B;

**Rehearsal 2: 🇩🇪 Germany – ISAAK – Always On The Run**

It’s time for Germany’s ISAAK now, with his power ballad *Always On The Run*. Like lots of singer/songwriters, ISAAK honed his craft as a street musician - he put on an impromptu street performance before the Pre-Party in Madrid, so hopefully we’ll see him out and about on the streets of Malmö over the coming week too.

This staging has had a major overhaul since *Das Deutsche Finale* back in February – ISAAK is also in a room, but rather than a filthy gym it looks like a very stylish living room, made from a black metal framework that means he can still be seen from all sides. It also has an open fire - and from the first chorus, all three sides of the room burst into flames, like the house is burning down. Hard to capture the atmosphere in words, but it's really impressive.

The set sits under the middle cube, which has descended from the heavens to create a ceiling, but during the middle eight the whole set is wheeled away and it’s just ISAAK in the middle of the stage, wearing a black suit and flanked by four backing singers.

Watching both on screen and on the stage, it’s a really impactful three minutes – ISAAK’s interaction with parts of the room, the flames, and the dynamic change of set halfway through really elevates what is already a powerhouse vocal.

We’ve see SO much great staging over the past week – still four more performances to go, but it’s shaping to be a VERY good year.

**Rehearsal 3: 🇸🇪 Sweden – Marcus & Martinus – Unforgettable**

Time for Sweden’s favourite Norwegians to rehearse now - it’s Marcus & Martinus, bringing some twin dance energy to the Malmö arena. This song will open the Grand Final on 11th May, and WHAT a way to start the show.

22-year-old Marcus & Martinus haven’t released an official video for this song, because they didn’t need to - the staging at Melodifestivalen is basically watching a super-polished pop video being made in real time.  They’ve brought the same show to Malmö, which means it’s our THIRD BOX OF THE DAY! The staging remains pretty much unchanged, down to the blue and black outfits and four backing singers in wraparound shades.

But what feels entirely different is the scale - the cubes add a new dimension and elevated lighting effects, particularly after the box separates halfway through and the rest of the performance plays out at the front of the stage. From then the LED wall and the cubes go full pulsing neon, and the whole thing has so much bass it pounds through the floor. Hard to imagine how anyone isn’t going to be up and dancing in this arena next Tuesday - this is a certified 'let's go to Euroclub' bop.

Since we're all about the boxes, we're wondering what France, Spain and Italy have in store for us...Slimane in a glass cube?  Suggestions please....

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**Rehearsal 4: 🇫🇷 France – Slimane – Mon Amour**

France’s Slimane is up next, with his sweeping ballad *Mon Amour*. He’s become an established star in his home country since he won The Voice (France) in 2016, and now has his sights set on Eurovision.

The staging for this performance has the same energy as the official video, with lots of close-ups of Slimane sharing his pain and asking the big questions about love. His vocal range and the simple piano accompaniment create a kind of breathless intensity, and nobody does his kind of chanson d’amour quite like France.

Staging wise, it starts with Slimane lying on the floor in a white suit, and he performs the first half of the song on his knees, interacting with the camera in a way that feels like a POV of a really intense argument. The juxtaposition of this with the questions he asks in the lyrics feels really immersive, like you’re part of the encounter. We might have just held our breath for three minutes.

At the end there’s a section where Slimane steps away from the mic and sings the final chorus entirely acapella, in a cloud of smoke. We’ve seen this element before during pre-party season, but in this big arena it creates a haunting echo. Photos coming soon!

**18:10 It’s dinner time!**

We’re taking a break for dinner now – back at 19:20 for Spain and Italy! Please don’t go away, we’re hoping for at least one more box before the end of the day. 🎁

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**19:20 Rehearsal 5 - 🇪🇸 Spain – Nebulossa – ZORRA**

Next up it’s Spain’s Nebulossa, bringing huge shoulders and big 80s synth-pop vibes to the Eurovision stage. They are made up of vocalist Mery Bas, and Mark Dasousa on keytar.

*Zorra* means ‘vixen’ in Spanish, but it’s also used to as a slur in relation to women – I would share the relevant words, but after Aiko bra-gate I’m trying not to crash the liveblog. So this song is about reclaiming the word *Zorra* and breaking free from the discrimination free-spirited women are subjected to.

It’s also a huge disco bop, and fans of Benidorm Fest \*waves in Spanish\*  will be delighted to learn that the circular red sofa has come to Malmo, but a front section has been painted gold so it’s giving very classy Spanish flag. We don’t find this out until the end of the intro, however, because this performance starts out INSIDE the middle cube – it’s the first time we’ve seen it lowered all the way to the stage. Which means there's ACTUALLY A BOX.  Incredible.

The whole vibe and aesthetic is very much what we saw at Benidorm Fest, but just bigger and more fabulous – with lyrics on the LED wall during the singalong sections, and huge ZORRAs pulsing on the cubes.

Mery’s costume is a sheer lace catsuit with flared trousers and giant puffy shoulders – we’ve just been told that it was designed by US designer Michael Costelloe and is encrusted with over 100,000 tiny crystals.

Her two male dancers, meanwhile, start out in stylish black suits, but they’re soon dispensed with to reveal bare chests, thonged corsets and PVC thigh boots. It's three minutes of pure theatre, and we can’t wait to hear the whole crowd singing along to this next week.

🔥 PYRO UPDATE: Floor smoke all the way though, and bonus chorus fireworks. Photos coming soon!

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**19:45 BOX COUNT UPDATE**

We're now four out of five in a box. Cumbia through, Angelina Mango.

&#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**20:00 CEST: Rehearsal 6 - 🇮🇹 Italy – Angelina Mango – La Noia**

We’ve made it to the final first rehearsal of 2024, and it’s Italy’s Angelina Mango singing her song *La Noia*. She was a big breakout star in Italy in 2023, with a sell-out tour and a huge TikTok following. Next stop Sanremo, then Eurovision. She describes her music as influenced by Italian and American rap, R’n’B and instrumental music, and La Noia has elements of all of these.

This feels like a huge departure from Angelina’s performance at Sanremo, and even the official video – Angelina has five female backing dancers, and the staging feels like it’s set in a forest of naked trees. It also starts out with four of the five cubes lowered to the floor, projected with branches to enclose the dancers. So…four ACTUAL BOXES.

They raise to reveal Angelina in the middle backed by a huge throne also made of interwoven twigs and branches. Her costume is a red sparkly corset with plant-like patterns on her legs and arms, and her dancers have a similar style but without the red, so it’s more of a nude effect. The whole effect of trees and plants and flowers on the LED wall has a really fantastical appeal – like a psychedelic, magical woodland, but make it fashion.

Incidentally, La Noia translates as ‘the boredom’, and Angelina dances her way through it - literally the ‘cumbia of boredom’.  Absolutely nothing boring about this staging – it’s full of colour and texture and richness.

🔥PYRO UPDATE - a curtain of fireworks at the back of the stage at the end! Photos coming soon...

**20:35 CEST: And with that, the Live Blogs are DONE for 2024!**

Apart from adding the remaining links, we're finished for the day. We've watched 37 incredible performances over the past six days, and the live shows next week are going to be a TREAT.

Now first rehearsals are done, it's also time to call time on this Live Blog - it’s genuinely been an absolutely joy to share everything that's been going on in the Malmö arena this week.

Tomorrow we’ll be back to AMAs with another batch of Eurovision stars - you can ask your questions [<here>](https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1cicvy3/ask_our_artists_anything_round_4/).

This is Heidi signing off on behalf of the Eurovision team – huge thanks for all your contribution and appreciation, and enjoy the live shows next week!

**09:35 CEST: Ready for Day Four?**

Hej everyone, and welcome back to Day Four of Eurovision rehearsals! We’re back in the Malmö arena for another day and another eight first rehearsals, which start as usual at 10:30 CEST. Today will wrap up the performances in the second Semi-Final, and then on Thursday we move on to the Big 5 and Sweden. Expect sneak peeks, exclusive photos, links to TikTok snippets, and important cube updates!

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**10:05 CEST: Your daily reminder!**

No need to read this if you’ve been here before. But if not, some useful info:

**How rehearsals work:**

* Each country has half an hour to rehearse – that’s usually enough time to run through their performance three times.
* If there is any pyro (smoke, flames, fireworks) they will be rehearsed in the final run-through. So we’ll add that information at the end.
* Usually the costumes worn in the first rehearsal are the ones you’ll see in the Semi-Final – but not always (example: Kaleen’s two different coats yesterday). We’ll try to share this info up front, but to be honest we don’t always know. Which leads us to…

&#x200B;

**How the Live Blog works:**

* We are seeing all these performances for the first time, and usually have no idea in advance what to expect. So we watch the first run-through with the laptop closed, then try to describe something inherently visual in words that fans from all across the world can understand. It takes time, and when staging is complex it can take even more time. We always want to do the performances justice, so please be patient ❤️
* Likewise photos and TikTok clips take time – we want to pick the best bits and make a nice edit. We’ll get them up as soon as we can.
* We are a digital content team of very talented writers, photographers, videographers and editors, but the ‘we’ of writing this liveblog is actually one person -  so it can be hard to stay on top of your questions. Happy to be here, grateful for your support, please join in and we’ll try to keep up!

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**10:30 CEST Rehearsal 1: 🇱🇻 Latvia – Dons - Hollow**

First up today is Latvia’s Dons – he’s a musical icon in his home country, so he’s no stranger to a big stage. His soulful power-ballad Hollow swept up both jury and public votes at Supernova, and its position in the running order (sandwiched between an Armenian folkbop and a San Marino rock anthem) feels like a soul-stirring vocal masterclass.

The staging for this features a huge circular prop (maybe three or four metres in diameter) - it's HOLLOW, so Dons performs the first half of the song standing inside it. It doesn’t move or spin or light up, but it does create a really powerful focal point on stage.

Dons is wearing his trademark royal blue sleeveless pantsuit (but with added robot abs), and he’s backed by an LED wall of gently pulsing lights and circles. The lighting effects are actually really clever  – lots of slow-moving blue spotlights in the verses that kick into much brighter, whiter lights in the chorus. They feel like searchlights, and it gives this whole performance a MOOD.

&#x200B;

**11:10 CEST Rehearsal 2: 🇸🇲 San Marino – Megara – 11/11**

Have we had enough coffee this morning? Not yet. Does it matter? Also no. Because Megara from San Marino are waking up the whole arena with their rock anthem 11:11. Their rehearsal started at 11:13, which is one of those things we will all just have to learn to live with.

Megara are still in the pink and black fur we saw at Una Voce per San Marino, but a slightly different design with added zebra stripes. The LED wall shows a pink and black animation with lots of spooky trees and dragons that feels like a fairy story – the whole thing comes together as a really cohesive bit of staging that feels fun, uplifting and very LOUD.

There’s a really fun dance routine that runs through this whole performance, which we don’t usually see with big rock bands, but Megara are definitely here to entertain – there’s even a moment at the end where Kenzy takes off her fur coat to reveal a new outfit featuring pink PVC armour with a dinosaur spine. We’re also happy to report that the flamenco dance break from the official video has made it to Malmö, with Megara’s two dancers shedding their fur coats to reveal skeleton bodysuits and fur boots.

🔥 PYRO UPDATE: smoke AND flame balls, with a huge fiery finish. If you have tickets for the arena standing area, dress for warm weather.

**11:50 CEST Rehearsal 3: 🇬🇪 Georgia – Nutsa Buzaladze - Firefighter**

Time for Georgia to rehearse, with Nutsa Buzaldze singing her dance track Firefighter. She’s competed in a singing competition or two, including American Idol in 2023, where she made the final. Yes, actual American Idol. She did a duet of Can’t Get You Out Of My Head with Kylie Minogue. This feels like a Eurovision fever dream, but there’s video evidence and everything.

Anyway, we know from pre-party season that Nutsa has some powerhouse vocals, and she’s definitely brought them to Malmö. She starts alone on stage on a raised plinth, under a red spotlight and  backed by red smoky graphics. At the end of the first verse she’s joined on buy four male dancers in black (with shirts) – it’s a VERY polished, high-energy dance routine with the LED graphics building through the song into sparking balls of flame.

Nutsa’s costume is a shiny gold mini-dress paired with boots – she doesn’t miss a note, despite the energetic routine. Pyro update (surely? SURELY?) and photos coming soon!

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 PYRO UPDATE: SO. MANY. FLAMES 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

**12:30: Rehearsal 4: 🇧🇪 Belgium - Mustii - Before The Party’s Over**

Time for Belgium’s Mustii now, rehearsing his dramatic ballad Before The Party’s Over. Mustii is a well-known name in Belgium - he’s a singer, actor and judge on Belgium’s version of Drag Race.

This performance brings a lot of the intense, slow-build mood we saw in the official video, with a circle of microphones on a smoky platform that slowly turns, and lots of cloudy graphics on the wall and floor. Mustii is wearing an open white shirt with a gem-encrusted top underneath that catches the arena light – it’s giving North Macedonia 2021 vibes, but more glam rock and less disco ball.

For the final section Mustii moves to front stage and lifts the roof off the arena – backing vocals for this song are provided by hundreds of Eurovision fans, so it’s very much a United By Music effort. The pounding drums at the end vibrate through the arena floor until you feel it in your chest - definitely another hold your breath moment from this year. Photos coming soon!

&#x200B;

**Rehearsal 5: 🇪🇪 Estonia - 5MIINUST x Puuluup - (nendest) narkootikumidest ei tea me (küll) midagi**

Ready to beat the post-lunch lull? No problem, because Estonia are rehearsing on stage next, and bringing plenty of their trademark energy.

We’ve seen some fun and eclectic collaborations at Eurovision over the years, and this year’s entry from Estonia is no exception - 5MIINUST are a well-known pop/hip hop group in Estonia, and Puuluup describe themselves as ‘a zombie folk duo’.

Note to Eurovision fact fans - this song has the longest single-language title in Eurovision history - (nendest) narkootikumidest ei tea me (küll) midagi, which translates as ‘we (really) don’t know anything about (these) drugs’.

The band all look very stylish in black suits with varying quantities of sleeves. The whole performance is a heady and joyful mix of thumping beats, traditional talharpa melodies and the 5MIINUST x Puuluup aerobic dance routine. We will definitely be recreating this in Euroclub next week.

Also the CUBES are down, lit up with more cube graphics that change colour through the performance to match the LED wall behind. A neon cube extravaganza, and a LOT of fun. Photos coming soon!

&#x200B;

**Rehearsal 6: 🇮🇱 Israel – Eden Golan – Hurricane**

Next up in the Semi-Final running order will be Italy’s Angelina Mango, who isn’t rehearsing until Thursday. So instead we’re skipping straight to 20-year-old Eden Golan from Israel, singing her power-ballad *Hurricane*.

Eden isn’t just a talented singer - she’s also a songwriter, composer, producer and dancer. She won Israel’s biggest talent show HaKokhav HaBa (‘The Next Star’) back in February, along with the chance to represent Israel at Eurovision.

On stage we have our second big circular prop of the day – it’s the same style as Latvia’s, but smaller, lit up with neon and featuring a built-in wind machine. It’s also has ladders each side, so it can be used as a support for five dancers - three male, two female – who take their complex contemporary dance routine from around the circle to the front of the stage.

The dancers’ costumes are off-white and grey, to complement Eden’s long flowing dress.  The whole performance has the same aesthetic as the official video – and as you’d expect for a song called *Hurricane*, the LED wall features lots of swirling colour. Our second big ballad of the day, with huge  vocals to match. Photos soon!

&#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**Rehearsal 7: 🇳🇴 Norway - Gåte – Ulveham**

Two more rehearsals to go today, and next up Is Norway! Gåte have been performing together for over twenty years - their sound is a mix of rock and Norwegian folk. Their song, *Ulveham* is a folk tale about a maiden with an evil stepmother who is banished to the woods, transformed into a wolf and ordered to kill her brother. We are not expecting a dance break.

What we ARE getting, however, is the whole dark, witchy mood of this song, very similar to Gåte’s performance at Melodi Grand Prix but on an epic Malmö scale. A low, slow-spinning platform with some rocks and trees, like a goth terrarium, backed by spooky swirling graphics, lots of atmospheric lasers and green spotlights.

We’ve seen lead singer Gunnhild in lots of amazing outfits over pre-party season - today she’s wearing dark green wide trousers with a matching top that designed to look like she has leaves woven across one shoulder. In the final chorus guitarist Magnus throws his guitar high into the air, then catches it – we can only imagine how many guitars have been sacrificed for this big finish.

This is one of the harder performances to describe today because it’s pure atmosphere – a mix of pounding drums, building vocals and Gåte giving it everything.

PYRO UPDATE - lots of low swirling fog has been added to the stage in the final run-through.

**Rehearsal 8: 🇳🇱 Netherlands - Joost Klein - Europapa**

Our final rehearsal for today is from musician, writer and artist Joost Klein from the Netherlands, who will be wrapping up the second Semi-Final with his banging dance track Europapa. Come for the high-energy rave and the lyrical tour of Europe, stay for the bit at the end where it goes full happy hardcore.

Fans of Joost will be delighted that his signature dance moves and giant blue shoulder pads have be shipped to Malmö, along with a keyboard player dressed as a fluffy blue and yellow bird – presumably to represent both the EU flag but also conveniently repping Sweden. The LED wall is a manic visual tour of the lyrics, and the whole thing is three minutes of infectious dance energy, with Joost flanked on stage by two dancers in white tracksuits.

Thank you for wrapping up Day Four with your pure positivity, Netherlands. We definitely need a lie down. Photos coming soon!

**09:50 CEST: We’re BACK!**

God morgon Eurofans, and welcome back to Day Three of Eurovision rehearsals! We’re back in the Malmö Arena once again, ready to give you a front row sneak peek at all the staging, costumes, pyro, props, dance breaks and cube activity.

Eight acts are rehearsing today, and as usual rehearsals start at 10:30 CEST, so join us then for a day-long megathread. We’ll also be sharing exclusive photos, TikTok links, and maybe some snaps of fun stuff we’ve spotted backstage. Who are you most looking forward to seeing today?

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**10:00 CEST: Daily reminder!**

If you’re returning, you’ll know all this already and should feel feel to ignore. But if you’re a new arrival – here’s some useful info:

**How rehearsals work:**

* Each country has half an hour to rehearse – that’s usually enough time to run through their performance three times.
* If there is any pyro (smoke, flames, fireworks) they will be rehearsed in the final run-through. So we’ll add that information at the end.
* Usually the costumes worn in the first rehearsal are the ones you’ll see in the Semi-Final – but not always (example: Luxembourg yesterday). We’ll try to share this info up front, but to be honest we don’t always know. Which leads us to…

**How the Live Blog works**:

* We are seeing all these performances for the first time, and usually have no idea in advance what to expect. So we watch the first run-through with the laptop closed, then try to describe something inherently visual in words that fans from all across the world can understand. It takes time, and when staging is complex it can take even more time. We always want to do the performances justice, so please be patient ❤️
* Likewise photos and TikTok clips take time – we want to pick the best. We’ll get them up as soon as we can.
* We are a digital team of writers, photographers, videographers and editors, but the ‘we’ of writing this liveblog is actually one person -  so it can be hard to stay on top of your questions. Delighted to be here, grateful for your support, please join in and we’ll try to keep up!

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**10:20 CEST: Where are we today?**

We’ve gone up up up up up uuuupp to the second tier today, and even Hera Björk would enjoy the view from up here.

For info, all of you asking for us to check out the VIP areas, we don’t have access yet – since it’s still a week until the live shows, setup work is still ongoing. We have every confidence it will be as fabulous as the rest of this arena.

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**10:30 CEST: Rehearsal 1: 🇲🇹 Malta - Sara Bonnici – Loop**

First up today it’s Sarah Bonnici from Malta, rehearsing her song *Loop*. This will open the second Semi-Final on 9th May, and it’s a huge pop diva banger to get the Thursday party started.

This isn’t Sarah’s first Eurovision rodeo - she was a backing dancer at Junior Eurovision in 2010. But now she’s back with Xtina and Britney vibes, not to mention the HUGE dance break.

Talking of which, we have one of the team in the arena today who just so happens to know every move of Sarah’s dance routine (say hello to Remi, he’s French). So he’s able to tell us that the main routine is largely the same other than having been polished up a bit in places. BUT the dance break has had a rework – it still has the flip, but with added shirt removal by the four male backing dancers, and also…blindfolds. There’s also a very impressive salsa-style shoulder lift.

Costume-wise, Sarah is in a sparkly silver bodysuit, and THE CUBES are getting their first LED action of the day. Not that anyone will be looking at the graphics - this is  QUITE the show. Photos coming soon!

PYRO UPDATE! Fireworks during the big note in the bridge before the final chorus, and a big firework finish. We are now fully awake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**11:10 CEST: Rehearsal 2: 🇦🇱 Albania – Besa – Titan**

Time for Albania’s Besa to rehearse now – this song has had a rework since Besa won the Albanian *Festivali i Këngës* final back in December - the original song *Zemrën N’dorë* is now called *Titan* and is sung in English.

Besa’s costume is bringing the first pointy shoulders of the day, as part of a blue and black pantsuit with gold detailing. She also has two backing singers, and three female dancers in nude bodysuits who perform a contemporary routine. Projections of more dancers on the LED wall and the cubes give it even more scope and drama, so it feels like they fill the stage. Simple, but really effective.

The way this song goes full drum ‘n’ bass in the final chorus gives it a really epic finish, and the tempo of the dancing is ramped up to match.

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**11:50 CEST: Rehearsal 3: 🇬🇷 Greece – Marina Satti – ZARI**

It’s Greece’s turn to rehearse now, marking their 50th year at Eurovision. Their entry this year is singer-songwriter Marina Satti with the song ZARI - a fusion of Greek, Arabic and Balkan influences that manages to sound both traditional and super-contemporary.

In terms of staging, Marina brings the same sass and attitude we saw in the official video - the kilt has been swapped for a shiny purple puffball skirt, paired with a white top and black heeled boots. Marina has four backing dancers – three male, one female - who join Marina to fuse precision street dance moves with traditional elements. There’s lots of close-up camerawork  – Marina really connects with the TV audience, and it looks great live on stage too.

In terms of graphics, there's loads of colour and energy – with neon pink floating ZARI graphics on the cubes, and grafitti-style visuals on the LED wall bringing that same urban vibe we saw in the official video.

It’s also another track this year with deep bass, so the TA TA TA really vibrates through the floor of the arena. Officially a banger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**CEST 12:30: Rehearsal 4: 🇨🇭 Switzerland – NEMO – The Code**

Time for Switzerland’s Nemo to rehearse now - they are a musician, singer and songwriter with a big following in Switzerland. *The Code* is a mix of rap, drum ‘n’ bass and opera, and we’ve seen over pre-party season that Nemo has the vocal range to deliver all three.

The video for this track gave us hope that Nemo might bring something super-creative to the Eurovision stage, and they have NOT disappointed – Nemo is wearing an outfit made of pink and white fur (with matching fur boots!), and their main prop is a white circular platform two or three metres in diameter. It tips and pivots in all directions – Nemo climbs it, slides down it, dances on it, jumps off it – the whole thing is a showcase of balance, precision timing and codebreaking ambition.

Not something we’ve EVER seen at Eurovision before -  welcome to the show, Nemo fans. Photos coming soon!

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

13:00 CEST: It's lunchtime! 🍕

Time for the arena to take a lunch break now - we'll be back at 14:10 CEST for Czechia, Austria, Denmark and Armenia. But we'll keep the laptop with us so we can add photos and TikTok links as soon as we have them. Whatever you're eating, enjoy!

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**14:10 CEST: We're back!**

Czechia's rehearsal starting very soon!

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**14:10: Rehearsal 5: 🇨🇿 Czechia – Aiko – Pedestal**

Time for our first pop/rock anthem of the season, with Czechia’s Aiko singing her high energy belter *Pedestal*. Aiko was born in Russia, raised in Czechia, and now splits her time between London and Prague.

We are very excited to tell you that we have been given STAGING NOTES by the Czechia team, which has literally never happened before (note to other delegations: yes please). They tell us that Aiko’s staging concept represents the five stages of grief during a breakup – Aiko is accompanied on stage by four female dancers, each representing Denial, Anger, Bargaining and Depression. Aiko herself represents the fifth and final stage – Acceptance.

The costumes are black bodystockings with mesh sections and lots of sparkle, and Aiko’s dancers have sparkly mesh face coverings. Aiko has a similar top section but with wide-legged trousers.

Also the CUBES are fully deployed in this performance – starting just a few feet above the performers’ heads, creating a more enclosed, domestic-feel environment that gets bigger and less confined as the cubes lift. Lots of black and red strobe lighting, and a really nice moment towards the end when Aiko’s dancers lift her above their heads. Aikonic, as we believe the kids are saying these days.

🔥🔥🔥🔥 PYRO UPDATE! Czechia have brought some relationship breakup flame jets that heat up the arena for the the entire first verse and the bridge into the second chorus, then return for a big finish. Definitely adds to the drama and storytelling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**15:00 CEST: Rehearsal 6: 🇦🇹 Austria – Kaleen – We Will Rave**

Austria’s Kaleen is here to remind us that if heartbreak is the problem, rave is the solution.

Kaleen is no stranger to Eurovision - she’s been one of the creative directors for years, and even pretended to be Eleni Foureira from Cyprus during the stand-in rehearsals in 2018.

Staging-wise, there’s an inverted pyramid made of metal scaffolding hanging above the middle of the stage, that shoots lasers, giving the stage a warehouse rave vibe. She starts the performance wearing a long white coat with a train, but that’s dispensed with as soon as the bass kicks in, revealing a silver sparkly leotard and matching thigh boots. She has four male backing dancers, wearing black cargo pants, sleeveless jackets and oversized wraparound shades. With Kaleen they deliver a full-on dance routine that covers the whole stage.

There’s also a RUM-DE-DUM-DA-DA hip swivel move that we will absolutely be practising in Euroclub. Genuinely wish it was possible to explain what this track FEELS like at full volume in the arena – it’s very much a full body experience. Photos coming soon!

PYRO UPDATE! Smoke and steam jets, AND Kaleen tried a different (and much fluffier) white coat. No idea which will make it through to second rehearsals - we'll find out later in the week!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**15:40 CEST: Rehearsal 7: 🇩🇰 Denmark – Saba – Sand**

Saba from Denmark is up next, rehearsing her song *Sand*. This power ballad builds from the soft, low-key start to the huge crescendo finish, and the staging does the same - using lighting and glittery graphics to add layer upon layer until Saba’s vocals fill the whole arena.

It’s very similar to the staging we saw at Denmark’s national final, Melodi Grand Prix, just on a bigger and more epic Malmö scale. Saba is wearing a white pant suit - if it's not the same she wore at MGP, it's very similar. The pockets are filled with sand, and she scatters it as part of really beautiful armography routine that mirrors a projected version of Saba on the LED wall behind her. Really simple, but all the more impactful for it.

Lots of floor smoke in the final run-through, which gives the whole performance even more drama. Photos coming soon!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**16:20 CEST: Rehearsal 8: 🇦🇲 Armenia – Ladaniva – Jako**

It’s the last rehearsal of the day – are we ready for an Armenian pop/folk fusion? The Jako of the title is the little-girl version of singer Jaklin, who along with French  instrumentalist Louis, make up Ladaniva. Sung in Armenian, Jako is about rejecting negative stereotypes, being free and being yourself.

The official video for this has lots of sass and energy, and that spirit has definitely been brought to the Malmö stage, along with Jaklin’s costume and trademark plaits. There’s also an island of brightly coloured plinths in the middle of the stage, where Ladaniva’s band stand on different levels playing their instruments.

In the second half the LED wall and cube graphics kick in, with Armenian motifs and lots of chickens - we are strongly advocating for a Croatia/Armenia farmyard crossover. The whole thing is a riot of colour and energy - a great way to end another fun day in Malmö arena.

**That’s Day Three DONE!**

We started this megathread seven hours ago, and have so far racked up combined liveblogs of nearly 24 hours. And there’s still two days of first rehearsals to go – eight more acts tomorrow, then the Big 5 and Sweden on Thursday.

We’re off to blink into the sunlight for a while until the final photos and TikToks come in, and then we’ll see you back on Reddit tomorrow for Day Four. Thank you for all your comments and questions, and for generally being entirely delightful.

Get ready for Latvia, San Marino, Georgia, Belgium, Estonia, Israel, Norway and Netherlands, starting at 10:30 CEST. See you then!

**10:00 CEST: We’re back for Day Two!**

Hej hej! It’s Day Two of Eurovision first rehearsals, and we’re back in the Malmö Arena with eight more countries on the schedule for their first rehearsal – Iceland, Slovenia, Finland, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Australia, Portugal and Luxembourg.

This megathread provides a front row seat for staging, costumes, exclusive photos, TikTok links and backstage goings-on. A must-read for Eurovision fans who can’t wait until the live shows to see what their faves have planned! Everything starts at 10:30 CEST, so please join us then!

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**10:05 CEST: A few reminders!**

**How rehearsals work:**

* Each country has exactly half an hour to rehearse – that’s usually enough time to run through their performance three times.
* If there is any pyro (smoke, flames, fireworks) they will be rehearsed in the final run-through. So we may add that information at the end.
* Usually the costumes worn in the first rehearsal is the one you’ll see in the Semi-Final – but not always. Sometimes artists use these rehearsals to try different things, because that's what rehearsals are for, right?

&#x200B;

**How the Live Blog works:**

* We are seeing all these performances for the first time, and have no idea in advance what to expect. So we watch the first run-through with the laptop closed, then try to describe something inherently visual in words that fans from all across the world can understand. It takes time, and we want to do the performances justice, so please be patient ❤️
* Likewise photos and TikTok clips take time – we want to pick the best. We’ll get them up as soon as we can.
* We are just one person (hello! I’m Heidi), and there are THOUSANDS of you (YAY), so apologies in advance if we miss some of your questions. But we love that you’re all here, and that we can share what’s going on in the arena with such an passionate audience. Thank you for joining in!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**10:30 CEST: Rehearsal 1: 🇮🇸 Iceland – Hera Björk – Scared Of Heights**

First up to rehearse today is Hera Björk, who is no stranger to the Eurovision stage, having previously represented Iceland back in 2010. She’s a legendary pop diva both back at home in Iceland and amongst the Eurovision fandom, and this song is another of her trademark uplifting pop bangers.

Hera has swapped the Söngvakeppnin red sparkly jumpsuit for gold and VERY sparkly, with fringing to aid fearless flight. We’ve heard it weights 6kg, but will confirm!

She starts on a black plinth (not high: fear not) backed by five backing singers. It’s very similar to the Söngvakeppnin performance, just on a Malmö scale – lots of gold graphics and silhouettes of dancers on the LED wall makes it feel like a big old party. We’re having a little chair bop in section A4 - WHAT a way to start the day.

YES to the comment that Hera's outfit looks like Conor from Wild Youth last year. Just SO much more glamorous. And less...tight.

No pyro for Iceland - Hera is sparkly enough.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**11:10 CEST: Rehearsal 2: 🇸🇮 Slovenia – Raiven – Veronika**

In the Semi-Final running order it will be Germany next, but today we’re skipping straight to Slovenia’s Raiven. She’s a seasoned performer in Slovenia - songwriter, harpist, theatre performer and mezzo-soprano.

Veronika is inspired by the story of Veronika Deseniška, a Slovenian noblewoman who fell in love with a member of the royal family and was accused and acquitted of witchcraft. One of the credited writers on this track is none other than Bojan Cvjetićanin, leader singer of last year’s Slovenian entry, Joker Out.

For staging, it’s Raiven in a dark silver bodysuit – she starts out on the floor, and her movements spark off pulsing graphics on the LED floor. She’s joined by five contemporary dancers in nude bodysuits, who perform a complex routine of intertwining bodies – the whole performance has a very similar feel to the official video – ethereal, but also VERY dramatic. And those high notes at the end take the roof off.

First pyro of the day! It's low fog and wind for Slovenia, which just adds to the drama.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**11:50 CEST: Rehearsal 3: 🇫🇮 Finland – Windows95Man – No Rules!**

Buckle in, it’s time for Finland’s Windows95man to rehearse No Rules! It’s still early in the rehearsal schedule, but we’ve had our coffee and are ready for a reboot.

Fans of their winning UMK performance will be delighted to hear that the Denim Egg Show has made it to Malmö, along with the ‘just within the rules’ nudity (a thong, we can confirm, hopefully secured with more than a couple of Clippy paperclips), tiny jorts and Henri Piispanen’s high notes. In fact, this pretty much a cut and paste of their UMK staging, but with even more processing power and a cloudy LED wall that’s giving 90s screensaver.

Listeners to the Official Eurovision Podcast will know that the backing dancers in this performance are inspired by Teemu’s love of Gina G’s *Ooh Aah…Just A Little Bit*. So Windows 95, inspired by Eurovision 96. We live for this kind of fun fact.

🔥 PYRO UPDATE: can confirm that the handheld fireworks and eggy smoke have returned. Photos coming soon!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

**12:30 CEST: Rehearsal 4: 🇲🇩 Moldova – Natalia Barbu – In The Middle**

How do you follow Windows 95? Well, with Windows 98, technically - but instead let’s watch Moldova’s Natalia Barbu rehearse her song In The Middle.

This is 11th in the running order for the first Semi-Final, or the thirteenth song we’ll hear if you count the United Kingdom and Germany. So not actually right in the middle, but close. It’s also not Natalia’s first time at Eurovision - she competed for Moldova in 2007, where she finished 10th.

The staging has the static routine that we saw at *Etapa Națională,* the Moldovan national final – with hand claps and armography and a white violin – but Natalia is no longer flanked by backing singers – she’s entirely alone, in front of a beautiful backdrop of seascapes and trees and flowers and butterflies.

During the violin section the LED wall turns to huge wings, so when viewed from the front Natalia looks like an angel. It’s completely different from anything we’ve seen on this stage so far in 2024, and really clever – and of course, Natalia hits every one of those high notes.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

13:00 CEST: It's time for lunch! 🥗

Time for the arena crew to take a break for lunch - we'll be back at 14:10 for Azerbaijan, Australia, Portugal and Luxembourg. We'll keep adding photos as soon as we get them!  Enjoy whatever you're eating (tell us in the comments, we love food chat).

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**14:10 CEST: Rehearsal 5: 🇦🇿 Azerbaijan - FAHREE feat. Ilkin Dovlatov - Özünlə Apar**

Time for Azerbaijan, with FAHREE performing a huge ballad sung in English and Azerbaijani. It has some lovely orchestral strings that fill the arena -  additional Mugham vocals are provided by Ilkin Dovlatov, and the whole thing comes together to create a mix of traditional Azeri sounds with a really contemporary edge.

FAHREE’s outfit is black and silver and gives off an armoured vibe, and Ilkin is in black with sparkly sleeves. For most of the song FAHREE is alone in the centre of the stage, backed my monochrome graphics that show an animated figure slowly emerging from water. In the second half two huge cupped hands appear on the stage so FAHREE can sing the final verse and chorus standing between them.

This is a really difficult performance to describe in words, because it’s less about the individual staging elements and more about the powerful atmosphere they create together – a combination of shadowy lighting, graphics, contrasting vocals and FAHREE’s expressive body movements.

The [official video](https://youtu.be/SUNM6dawXq8?si=5GFv55Jvewkrrnd-) to this song came out yesterday, and if you watch that you’ll get a good feel for the energy on stage right now.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**14:50 CEST: Rehearsal 6: 🇦🇺 Australia - Electric Fields - One Milkali (one blood)**

Time for Australia’s Electric Fields - fans may remember them from Australia Decides in 2019, when they were runners up to Kate Miller-Heidke and her wobbly pole.

The mathematics enthusiasts amongst you will know that the reference to ‘0.618’ is a Fibonacci sequence thing - hence ‘I stand in the eye of the spiral’. Sincere thanks to Electric Fields for bringing the golden ratio to Eurovision, it was long overdue. Art class yesterday, mathematics today.

Zaachariaha Fielding’s fabulous white dress captures the arena light and transforms into a rainbow at the start, and then this whole performance builds into an uplifting cosmic explosion of light and colour across both the LED wall and the floor and...THE CUBES. Zaachariaha is supported by Michael Ross on keyboards, two backing singers, and of course the didgeridoo.

There’s a lot of movement around the stage, which makes it feel like it’s a performance that aims to welcome in every corner of the arena – just pure joy from start to finish, and we’re delighted to add Yankunytjatjara, an Aboriginal language, to the Eurovision canon. Photos coming soon!

Also for anyone interested - we checked Zaachariaha's preferred pronouns, and either he/him or she/her is fine. So we're going with he/him, but you may see she/her elsewhere.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**1530 CEST: Rehearsal 7: 🇵🇹 Portugal - iolanda - Grito**

Next up in the running order will be Sweden, but as the host nation they won’t be rehearsing until Thursday. Instead it’s time for Portuguese singer/songwriter iolanda, rehearsing her song *Grito*.

The title translates as ‘Shout’, but there’s nothing shouty about this melodic ballad. It’s a fusion of pop and R ‘n’ B with traditional Portuguese Fado roots, and iolanda’s vocals seem to fill every corner of the arena, from the haunting acapella opening to the huge note at the end. It's a song that really builds over the three minutes, and even though it's a ballad, it still has a underlying bass  that vibrates through the floor. A song you feel through your feet and into your chest.

The staging is similar to iolanda’s win at Festival da Canção, with five white-clad dancers with covered faces performing a contemporary dance routine. They’ve also lowered the middle cube, which makes the space feel more intimate and adds to the artistry. Creative and hypnotic - we'll post some photos soon.

Note to self: investigate how delegations keep white outfits clean. Do they have spares? Are there express dry cleaning facilities in the Malmö arena? Will find out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

**16:10 CEST: Rehearsal 8: 🇱🇺 Luxembourg - TALI - Fighter**

Finally for today, it’s Luxembourg! After winning Eurovision five times, they took a 31-year break, but we’re delighted to welcome them back to the contest in 2024. They are represented by TALI, who will be closing the first Semi-Final on 7th May - as well as being a singer, she’s also a vocal coach and theatre performer, so she’s no stranger to a big stage.

*Fighter* (not to be confused with Georgia’s *Firefighter*, which is Tuesday) is a really catchy pop number sung in a mix of French and English.

Staging-wise, we have BONUS CUBES on stage, providing a frame for TALI and her five dancers. She’s in a black bodysuit (apparently this is not her final outfit - we should see that in the second rehearsal), and all her dancers are in different red outfits. Also like how their performance rotates to perform to each side of the audience - it really works with this stage configuration.

Also PYRO UPDATE - smoke, flames AND fireworks. Sparkly, fun and energetic – a great way to wrap up the first Semi. Bon retour parmi nous, Luxembourg. We’ve missed you.

&#x200B;

16:25 CEST: HOUSEKEEPING NOTE: if you're wondering where all the gallery and TikTok links have gone, they've moved to the table at the top of this thread. Much tidier!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------------

**Day Two is DONE**

Luxembourg has left the stage, and that’s another day done in the Malmö Arena, other than some more links to be added above. We won't forget, promise.

Thank you all for dropping by and giving us your joyful company. Same time tomorrow for Day Three? We’ll see rehearsals from Malta, Albania, Greece, Switzerland, Czechia, Austria, Denmark and Armenia - who are you most looking forward to?

Starting at 10.30 CEST - see you then!

10:00 CEST: **Welcome to Malmo!**

God morgon, and welcome to sunny Malmö for Day One of 2024’s Eurovision Song Contest rehearsals. We’re delighted to be partnering with Reddit this year, and hope you’ll stick with us for what is going to be the mother of all megathreads.

For those of you who don’t know, Eurovision rehearsals are closed to all but a very small production crew, and a handful of intrepid writers, photographers and TikTokers with special access to both the arena and the Eurovision Reddit account.

So if you want to get a first look at your favourite artist’s staging, costume and performance, this is the place to be. We’ll tell you what’s happening live as the rehearsals progress through the day, add some photos as soon as we can, and provide a link to an exclusive TikTok sneak peek. So keep Reddit open, make sure you’re following the official Eurovision account on Tiktok, and don’t go away.

Rehearsals will start at 10:00 CEST, and since we’re in Sweden, it’s reasonable to assume we’ll be on time. LET'S GO!

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------

Also just a small housekeeping note: it's Day 1, and we're still finding our feet in the arena, with the tech and the WiFi. So please be gentle with us if replies and photos and videos take a little longer today - we'll get into the swing of things very soon!

\----------------------------------------------------

10:25 CEST: **Ready for 360 staging?**

While we’re waiting, a bit about the staging. It’s completely different from previous years - for the first time, the stage is in the centre of the arena so artists are performing in the round. It looks amazing in an empty arena, and full of people it’s going to feel like a really immersive experience.

Even more excitingly, it means every artist this year is going to have to adapt their staging for a 360 audience, which hopefully means we’ll get a few surprises over the coming days.

On the downside, it means we can’t bag a comfy sofa in the Green Room, because this  year it’s hidden away behind a screen. Instead we have thousands of arena seats to choose from, which is both exciting and stressful. Which to choose?

For today we’ve bagged a seat in Block A20 - a great view, but this year EVERYWHERE in this arena is a great view.  By arena standards the seats are quite comfortable, but ask us again in eight hours.

If you have a ticket for one of the live shows, tell us where you're sitting and we'll check it out for you!

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------

10:30 CEST: **Rehearsals are starting!**

Some things to note:

* Each artist/band has exactly half an hour to rehearse - that's usually enough time to rehearse and reset three times. Sometimes it runs over a little, so there is a spare ten minutes between each rehearsal - so Cyprus is 1030 CEST, and Serbia is 1110 CEST.
* If there is any pyro (fireworks, flames, smoke, steam jets) - we'll only see it in the final rehearsal of the half hour - we'll definitely let you know!
* Costumes seen in first rehearsals aren’t always the one worn in the live show - artists use these closed rehearsals as an opportunity to try different outfits so we may see something different in second rehearsals next week.

\----------------------------------------------------

10:30 CEST: **Rehearsal 1: 🇨🇾** Cyprus – Silia Kapsis – Liar

Shall we get these rehearsals started? First up on stage is Silia Kapsis from Cyprus - she’ll be opening the first Semi-Final on May 7th with her song *Liar.* Silia is a singer and dancer of Greek and Cypriot descent, and she currently lives in Sydney, Australia.

Silia is only 17, but she’s owning this stage like performing in a huge arena is a walk in the park. The gold lamé costume from the official video has been replaced with trousers and a crop top in sparkly white, with four male backing dancers in cargo pants and baggy white t-shirts. No stage props, but lots of swirly green and red graphics on the LED backdrop and floor.

Fans of Silia's dancing will be happy to hear that this performance has a high energy routine and a huge dance break before the bridge into the final chorus - just the kind of upbeat number we need to get the party started on May 7th.

Also should mention that the dancers pull their shirts off in the final chorus. Sorry not to mention that sooner, we were looking the other way 😂

**Please check back here later for a link to the gallery and TikTok clip. Might take an hour or two as we navigate Day 1, but we'll post both as soon as we can!**

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------

11:10 CEST: **Rehearsal 2:** 🇷🇸 Serbia – TEYA DORA - RAMONDA

Time for a change of pace now - this year Serbia are represented by TEYA DORA, who is one of their most well-known recording artists. Her song *RAMONDA* is a haunting, heartfelt ballad - Ramonda is a purple flower that is a symbol of Serbian resilience and rebirth. There aren’t many ballads this year – it’s a VERY banger-heavy year – so we’re taking a moment to relax and sway gently.

The staging for this song is very similar to when TEYA DORA won *Pesma za Evroviziju*, Serbia’s national finals, back in March. A big rock (we think the same one as the NF, but can't been 100% sure),  shadowy lighting, graphics of clouds and stars and lightning, finishing with a blooming ramonda flower.

TEYA DORA's costume is a dark grey dress with a long layered skirt - all very dramatic and atmospheric. Photo coming soon!

PYRO UPDATE! Lots and lots of smoke in the final run through, so that's what you'll see on 7th May. For art fans, it reminds us of Caspar David Friedrich's *Wanderer above the Sea of Fog.* Niche, we know.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

11:50 CEST: **Rehearsal 3**: 🇱🇹 Lithuania – Silvester Belt - Luktelk

Every year at Eurovision there are a handful of performances with bass so deep it vibrates through the arena floor and you can feel it in your chest. Luktelk from Lithuania’s Silvester Belt is the first of those this year – it’s a full body experience.

Luktelk translates as ‘wait/hold on’, and according to Silvester the song is about being stuck in limbo between two stages of barely existing and feeling alive, when you have to hold on and dance through whatever life throws at you.

Can confirm we are dancing, and have never felt more alive.

The staging for this needs no props – similar to the Lithuanian national finals, EUROVIZIJA.LT – it’s Silvester in his red leather suit, backed by four male dancers with masked faces and lots of red and back strobe lighting. The masks have had an upgrade - less like turtlenecks and more like black hoods.

No pyro for Lithuania - photo and TikTok link coming soon!

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

12:30 CEST: **Rehearsal 4:** 🇮🇪 Ireland – Bambie Thug – Doomsday Blue

Ready for something completely different? Not just from Lithuanian electro-pop, but from everything else you’re going to hear at Eurovision this year.

Ireland’s Bambie Thug describes their sound as ‘Ouija-pop’, because it entirely defies conventional musical categorisation – our best description would be ‘witchy metal/melodic pop’. Doomsday Blue is about the feeling of having your potential overlooked, and is an ode to the queer community.

So: staging. Bambie is inside a circle of candles, wearing a black dress with a tutu skirt and shoulder horns. Their usual dramatic white face makeup is topped with hair styled into antlers. There’s also a bare-chested dancer giving centaur vibes, who accompanies Bambie in some balletic choreography.

In the final section the candle circle raises up, and the big screamo finish concludes with a graphic backdrop of CROWN THE WITCH. Pure Eurovision theatre, and testament to the diversity of musical styles we're going to see at Eurovision this year.

We're just about to watch it again, so will update if we notice anything else! Also we'll add a photo as soon as we can.

🔥 PYRO UPDATE: In the final run-through there is both low-level ground smoke throughout, AND our first flame jets of the day, right at the end. We are twenty metres from the stage and can feel the heat.

13:00 CEST: LUNCH BREAK! 🥗

The arena team are taking a break for lunch now - we'll be back just after 14:00 CEST for three more rehearsals from Ukraine, Poland and Croatia. In the meantime we'll add more photos and TikTok links as soon as we can. See you back here in an hour!

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

14:00 CEST: We're back!

Apologies for the delay on the Bambie Thug picture, boring WiFi story. We are still navigating a new arena so please bear with us.

We've just done a full tour of the first tier of arena seating and can confirm there are NO BAD SEATS in this arena. We'll take a look at the second tier tomorrow, but for this afternoon's session we're sitting in block A3. Also it's lovely and cool in here, bordering on chilly because the arena is empty. So should be perfect for the live shows!

Ukraine's rehearsal starting shortly!

\----------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

14:10 CEST: **Rehearsal 5**: 🇺🇦 Ukraine – alyona alyona & Jerry Heil – Teresa & Maria

In the Semi-Final 1 running order, the UK’s Olly Alexander will be performing next, but his first rehearsal isn’t until Thursday. So next on stage today is Ukraine’s alyona alyona & Jerry Heil.

Since the introduction of Semi-Finals in 2004, Ukraine is the only country who has qualified in every competition they have participated in. This year they’ve sent two of the country’s most successful artists to defend that record, with their pop/rap fusion Teresa & Maria.

They’ve definitely elevated the staging from their performance at Vidbir, with our second on-stage rock of the day. This is more of a rocky slope, like a mix of TEYA DORA’s rock and Brunette’s prop from last year. Jerry Heil climbs it into a wind machine, then alyona alyona emerges from stage right to deliver her rap interlude with heart and soul.

Everything about this – Jerry Heil's ethereal floaty dress, the shadowy figures on the LED wall, the choral backing vocals, feels hymnal and haunting.

There's no pyro in this performance, but there is a beautiful overhead shot at the end that incorporates their two bodies into a multi-person visual.

&#x200B;

14:50 CEST: **Rehearsal 6**:  🇵🇱 Poland – LUNA – The Tower

Next up to rehearse is Poland’s LUNA, who is a singer, songwriter and theatre performer from Warsaw. It’s three minutes of upbeat inspo-pop with a super-catchy chorus - there are a LOT of bops at Eurovision this year, so anyone with tickets to the arena shows needs to wear their best dancing shoes.

Staging-wise, LUNA is revealed on stage from between two huge neon chess rooks that roll across the stage. She’s wearing a shiny PVC-esque red cape with huge pointy shoulders (Joost Klein, the bar has been set). The cape is removed to reveal a long white dress with red horns  – never thought we’d be adding ‘lethal shoulders’ to the costume themes this year, but every Eurovision is a new adventure. The skirt then disappears to, and the final look is white shorts.

LUNA also has three faceless backing dancers in black, white and red respectively, and there’s a great moment when she lies on the LED floor and appears to ride a red horse. Huge sci-fi chess vibe, and a very clever piece of visual theatre.

🔥 PYRO UPDATE: In the final run-through - there's are big firework jets all round the stage in the final chorus.

15:30 CEST: **Rehearsal 7**: 🇭🇷 Croatia – Baby Lasagna – Rim Tim Tagi Dim

Time for our last rehearsal of the day (how time flies when you’re having fun) - and it's Croatia. After Let 3 set a high bar for memorable performances in Liverpool last year (underpants, anyone?), this year singer-songwriter Marko Purišić, aka Baby Lasagna, has seized the baton with Rim Tim Tagi Dim - a unique blend of rock, folk, techno and angry violins that tells a story about leaving home to find better opportunities.

Staging wise, the set-up is similar to when Baby Lasagna swept the board at Dora 2024 – elements of traditional dancing, Baby Lasagna in giant frilly sleeves, great use of the whole stage. BUT the whole performance has been polished up for Malmö, from the dance routine to the herd of neon farm animals on the LED wall. Dancing neon cats make an appearance right at the end – surely this will have some pyro? We’ll meow back as soon as we know…

🔥 PYRO UPDATE: Big smoke jets during the violins, then fire jets in each chorus and cracker fireworks before the techno bridge. By FAR the biggest pyro display of the day - who will it be tomorrow?

eurovision,Malmö 2024: Producers to get more “choice” in deciding Grand Final running order,341,2024-04-16 12:51:47+00:00,"In March it was revealed that some major changes would be introduced in Malmö to make the Eurovision Song Contest even more exciting. Following the announcement of the “Big 5” performing their songs in full in the Semi-Finals and that fans can vote as soon as the first artist takes to the stage in the Grand Final, we now have another big change to reveal!

In recent years, the qualifying countries from the Semi-Finals and the Big 5 have chosen which half of the Grand Final they will perform at random. The producers of the show then decided where in the First Half (songs 1 to 13) or Second Half (songs 14 to 26) of the Grand Final those acts would perform. 

This year a new “Producer’s Choice” category will be introduced.

Host broadcaster SVT has revealed that 25 of the 26 artists in the Grand Final (Sweden has already drawn position 1) will be able to pick First Half, Second Half or Producer’s Choice in a random draw.

This means that if an artist pulls out Producer’s Choice in the random draw – the show producers will be able to place that song anywhere in either the First or the Second Half of the running order.

The change means there will now be 6 places to pick in the First Half of the running order, 6 places that can be chosen in the Second Half and 13 Producer’s Choice places.

The reason for the change is to give producers of the show even more of an opportunity to make all songs in the Grand Final stand out and create the most exciting running order possible. 

Christer Björkman, this year’s Contest Producer, explains more about the reasons for the change: 

*“It's all about creating the best TV show possible and giving all artists a chance to shine. In previous years, with just the First Half and Second Half draws you might find many ballads ended up in the same part of the show or many favourites were drawn to perform in the same half. Adding the flexibility of Producer’s Choice gives me the ability to create an even better flow of different tempos and an even more thrilling Grand Final.”*

The Big 5 will be picking either First Half, Second Half or Producer’s Choice after their second Rehearsal on Saturday 4 May, live during a **Reddit AMA**. 

Then each of the 10 qualifiers from the First Semi-Final on Tuesday 7 May will draw one of those three options from the bowl immediately after the show LIVE on the Official Eurovision Song Contest TikTok channel.

The 10 qualifying artists from the Second Semi-Final will draw from the remaining options live on TikTok after the show finishes on Thursday 9 May. 

When all the 25 options are chosen, producers will compile the running order for the Grand Final of the 68th Eurovision Song Contest in the early hours of Friday 10 May. It will then be revealed on the Contest’s website and social media channels.",https://www.reddit.com/r/eurovision/comments/1c5fbut/malmö_2024_producers_to_get_more_choice_in/
