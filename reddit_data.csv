The game I am playing supports procedural leaning based on an axis input, but it seems as though Steam Input limits the gyro to only being mapped to a 2-axis input, as opposed to the 3 axises supported by the DualSense. 

Even if it is a controller setup limitation (shouldn't be since DirectInput can support far more axises than XInput but whatever) I would be relatively okay with just rebinding the two analogue triggers to the gyro's roll and then using keyboard controls to replace their lost functionality, but from what I can see that doesn't seem to be an option either since gyro roll can only be bound to action sets.

mrmivo,"Someone asked me why I am ""loyal"" to Steam. Here is what I said. What are your reasons?",484,2024-05-31 10:20:16+00:00,"Someone on a different subreddit said to me in a comment that they don't understand why I (and other PC gamers) are ""loyal"" to Steam and why we won't embrace other store fronts.

This is what I said to them:   


It's not about tribalism-like loyalty for me. Here are some of the reasons why I buy my PC games on Steam:

* active support for Linux - not just lip services, but they invest development resources and money into Linux as a gaming platform unlike anyone else
* consumer-friendly, hassle-free refund policy that they implemented before other platforms,
* pro consumer orientation in general, like the uncensored reviews that no other storefront offers,
* the community features, like friend lists, forums, curators, joining games through the friend list, customizable profiles, etc.
* best store front features, like actually powerful and useful filters, sortable wishlist, ignore list, dynamic bundles with price adjustments if you already own parts of a bundle,
* great library management tools, like categories, ""folders"", actually working time tracking, etc,
* a full-featured client that works and is configurable, backup and restore features,
* free cloud features for game saves, screenshots, and some custom content,
* extensive support for mods,
* light DRM only that is also optional (chosen by developer).

Nobody else offers the same. In addition, Steam has been around for a long time now, and there is a certain element of trust. They haven't pulled any truly questionable stunts, behaved unusually erratically (like, say, Ubisoft), and they are a privately owned company, which afford them a fair amount of independence.

There is never a guarantee, but if a company has a long track record of behaving comparatively ethical (for a for-profit company of this size), it creates trust and confidence. They have never paid for exclusivity, either, or tried to bind developers to them by force, even though they have the market share and the resources to do it. They have no actively tried to build a monopoly (by buying exclusive distribution rights, forcing their store on OEM machines, etc). They are the most popular PC distribution platform because they do it better than anyone else.

The other thing is, like you said, I don't want to use multiple different launchers (all of which collect data, need to be updated, etc) and I don't want my payment information in unnecessarily many places. The Steam client has never given me any trouble, I have never had real problems with Valve as a company. Why would I not want to keep buying there? Every other storefront offers a worse experience with worse features to me.

I don't believe that Steam is perfect, but now that we're stuck with digital distribution in the PC space, I'll stick to the company that does it best in the most consumer-friendly way (there is of course room for improvement, but some of these need to be facilitated by law makers). Yes, quasi-monopolism is an issue and a concern, but Steam is the closest to a benevolent tyrant that there is. Everyone else is worse or offers less.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1d4sa3m/someone_asked_me_why_i_am_loyal_to_steam_here_is/

NathanRowe10,Opinion: Valve should allow users to manually configure cloud saves if they so wish (with some limitations),5,2024-05-31 08:26:05+00:00,"Getting a Steam Deck really made me realize just how many games have completely screwed up cloud saves, some more than others but all being completely preventable. Night in the Woods doesn't sync across platforms, Metro 2033 Redux doesn't sync Windows saves to begin with, Metro Exodus doesn't have cloud saves on Linux and syncs graphics settings on Windows, Kero Blaster syncs so many graphics settings it doesn't sync all your save data, Dark Souls 3 has cloud saves set up but manually disabled for no reason, many games don't have cloud saves AT ALL, so on and so forth.

And the biggest issue by far: there's no real work around right now. Your choice is either manually moving the files around, which can be really time consuming, especially since apps break all the time, and you often lose track of which system has the most recent save; or you can whine to the developers to fix it for you and hope they do something about it (spoilers: they won't).

My idea for a fix: allow users to customize Steam AutoCloud. Specifically AutoCloud, as letting users cutomize games that use the API would be wholly unnecessary and a LOT more work. For those who don't know, some games use Steam Cloud's API, which is more complicated but allows for more intricate use of cloud saves; the vast majority of games however use Steam AutoCloud, which allows developers to set up cloud saves without making a single change to their game's data, and without writing a line of code themselves. It's not as versatile, but it's far more user-friendly.

However as you can tell, the user is totally unable to change that setup themselves, which leads to the examples in the first paragraph where many games just don't work. I think that should change. Allow users to edit the behavior of AutoCloud to suit their preferences, or to fix some developers' screw-ups where they can't be bothered to fix it themselves.

Some would point out this would allow people to just sync whatever files they want, which is why I think the ***one thing*** that shouldn't be changeable is the maximum size of the files. If someone wants to sync some random unrelated files, so be it, but they can't go above the game's cloud sync limit.

Some would also say the fact you can sync unrelated files is still an exploit to which I say...brother, you can already do that in a lot of games. A lot of games just sync all files in a directory, regardless of the file's name. That's not a new exploit, and I don't imagine it's one anyone would ever realistically use.

To be totally honest I'm surprised Valve hasn't introduced a feature at least somewhat like this, especially considering they seem to be pushing cloud saves harder and harder, what with their UI changes making the cloud sync icon far larger than before and everything. Again, why not let people fix their games where developers won't? There's plenty of games I would love to play, but refuse to buy purely because they don't have cloud saves, and I know if a game doesn't have cloud saves I'm just going to end up putting it down and never touching it again. It happened with Hylics 1 and 2, it happened with Risk of Rain, it would happen with Cave Story+, too.

almondeyecutie,How to buy a gift?,11,2024-05-31 01:16:30+00:00,"Hi guys. I’m really ignorant to gaming and don’t know anything about anything. My boyfriend’s birthday is coming up and I want to get him a game. I was thinking Sekiro shadows die twice. But he doesn’t have an Xbox or PS5, he has a gaming PC. He also has a switch but I think that’s for us playing Mario? Idk. He doesn’t use it that much.

Any who, I came across Steam. Do I just buy a Steam gift card? Will he be able to buy this game and play it on his gaming laptop? Or does he have to have a PS5 or Xbox?

I’m really confused and don’t wanna spend $500 on a PS5 if that’s not necessary. Also open to other game recs. He loves dark souls and Elden ring.

Thanks in advance from an ignorant gf!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1d4jopn/how_to_buy_a_gift/

bvpqeh,Would you like a steam monthly subscription similar to Xbox/pc game pass?,27,2024-05-30 19:26:35+00:00,"I have been using physical disc media for the consoles and I realised very soon that the secondary market for the physical disc is actually very huge. I can get rid of games that I no longer wish to play in the secondary markets, I really don’t like owning games especially digital versions.

Coming to digital some popular games that are digital only I had to buy it from the playstation or Xbox stores but I no longer use any consoles sold them as they don’t do much other than entertainment.(but the platforms are really great for entertainment only). But whatever digital games were purchased had to be abandoned for which I feel is a huge waste of money.

 But pc could do more than just entertainment. Switching to pc steam is the only service that almost provides a console experience on the pc platform because of it’s large library of games . But the problem is once again the digital media has to be bought. 

So can we solve this by taking inspiration from the music industry. Few years before we had to buy individual song/album and listen to music and again drawback of digital media is it has to be abandoned in between and imagine such a waste of money. Coming back to today no one buys a song/album but people are subscribed to the music plans and people are happy to give money as they are not owning anything and pay as long as they want the service. This way there is much wider and bigger user base of the service. Which is a win win situation for both the company and the consumer.

So would it workout for the gaming industry especially now Xbox game pass is going to become huge as they’ll be including next call of duty game black ops 6 in the game pass on day one. You subscribe and get to play huge titles without actually owning them.

 Should steam step into subscription based model. It would be win win situation for both sides. What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1d4c743/would_you_like_a_steam_monthly_subscription/

UnlikelyAdventurer,"Goodbye, Steam. Killing the accounts of the deceased is such an anti-consumer move that you don't deserve our money. Hello, GOG. ",156,2024-05-29 09:39:47+00:00,"Denying the inheritance of games bought on Steam an excessively shitty move on Steam's part. Nice move, especially at a time when people are grieving. It is such an anti-consumer move that I am now buying on GOG instead of Steam.

None of Valve's anti-consumer behavior has driven me away, but this did it. I'd be interested in hearing excuses for why people are sticking with Steam when GOG lets your family inherit the games you paid for. (You have no family or loved ones? You don't actually love your family or loved ones? You enjoy losing the things you pay for? You stopped thinking about tomorrow? Your kids hate games? The dead don't care? Etc.)

But for me, Steam does not deserve another penny when I can spend the same money for an INHERITABLE game on GOG.

EDIT:  
There is a surprising lack of awareness of Valve's recent claim that ""Steam account cannot be transferred via a will."" Here is a link to it:  
[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/)

There is also a surprising amount of support for Valve's anti-consumer behavior, but PT Barnum and HL Menken have explained this kind of phenomenon.

What people don't seem to know is how much courts and legislators have begun to address the issue of digital inheritance, and that anti-consumer moves like Valve's could be illegal:

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44804599](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44804599)

There is also a very simple solution that fits within Valve's current terms of service:  
""You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve."". 

Valve clearly already has an exception to password sharing. All Valve has to do is to ""specifically authorize"" password sharing as authorized by the court in an inheritance proceeding.

People can support that commonsense solution, or they can go on supporting anti-consumer practices.

Valve's policy might already be in violation of US law:

Been researching Live Service Games and ran into this. All 10 top PC games in terms of monthly active users (MAU) are live service games or lean heavily towards live service features, with an average of almost a decade on the market.

How many of these games would be profitable (or even break even) if they rebranded back into traditional pay-to-play premium games. I see **League of Legends** trying to dip back into the conventional pay-to-play market with Riot Forge Games (their indie branch), and GTA VI will obviously have a single-player game. That said, I find it hard to imagine any other games to even try. Would you play **Counter-Strike 3: Couch Co-op Split Screen Campaign** or **Call of Duty: the Metroidvania Side Scroller**? Can a pure pay2play premium game like BG3 push back to this list, maybe with the help of some mods?

redlinebmxone,Best way to level up in Steam!,19,2024-05-28 23:24:53+00:00,"I made a comment on a post that got locked out so I figured I would just make a post:

Go to the community market and search ""sack of gems"" They are about $0.30 each. Use them to make booster packs for games you have. Create a new category in your Steam library with the filter ""trading cards"". That will tell you what games to play to get your drops for those games. The badge menu will show you how many cards per game and game time. Craft badges like crazy. Don't buy levels, level up the right way. Spend your money on game deals and Sacks of gems. If you are missing cards in a set you can buy them on the market.

Doing it this way will give you tons of badges and your profile will look so much better then just having higher levels.

You can use this webpage to see what badges you like: [https://www.steamcardexchange.net/](https://www.steamcardexchange.net/)

After you have the badge you want you can sell the extra cards and items on the Steam exchange giving you a never ending supply of new card money. I have tons of sales all the time.

After doing this for over 2 years I have 120 badges, over 1000 chat items, hundreds of items on sale and I'm going too be level 70 soon. My profile looks crazy!

Just do it the correct way, You'll get more from it plus it supports the market.

Edit:  I also noticed you can zoom in on cards and screen shot them for Wallpapers.... Just another added bonus.

Update: I'm not sure what all the hate is about, this is just a walkthrough on how to do it. Nobody is forcing you. If you don't want levels, badges and chat items keep your basic profile. I plan to stay with Steam so I like adding to my profile. Cost me less then a monthly Xbox live Gold sub. So do what you want. If you don't want to support the community why are you here? Or Steam for that matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1d2xtze/best_way_to_level_up_in_steam/

I have it set to boot into my account with no password, with Steam as my only startup program and also set to boot into big picture automatically.

Is there any way to switch output from within big picture? Someone mentioned that you can select audio outputs via Xbox Game Bar, but the problem is that I've had Game Bar strictly set to a keyboard shortcut mostly because I don't ever use it, but also because I use the Xbox button for Steam (navigating big picture, opening steam overlay in-game, opening big picture, etc).

Why you may ask? Well, first of all I hate the idea of restarting a game bc I died (that's lame but that's just how it is for me about roguelike games) and second I want to experience the game with as much time as possible (I only criticize sections of games where timers are not necessary. E.g. Outer Wilds operates on a loop which, at least in my opinion, is useless since the story would be great even without it).

Slawrfp,Your Steam account is inheritable if you are American.,170,2024-05-27 15:32:32+00:00,"And so are all your other online accounts. I keep seeing articles popping up explaining how the inheritance of Steam accounts is impossible due to Valve's subscriber agreement and that there is nothing that can be done about it legally speaking. You should know that if you're American, there are already laws in place in many states that can help you bequeath your Steam account  and other game libraries regardless of what Valve or anyone else write in their EULA.

Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA) allows a digital executor to stand in your place online should you die or become incapacitated. Essentially, RUFADAA allows you to specify in your will who can access and manage your online accounts as well as the level of access that they would have. The level of access you can grant in your will ranges from transferring full ownership of your accounts to only allowing your executor to close your accounts after your death. I made this thread to discuss Steam accounts, but the legislation allows you to bequeath all your digital assets which include social media profiles, dating profiles, emails accounts, subscription service accounts (which would cover things like Steam, Xbox, PS, Amazon accounts) and more.

As of right now, I cannot find a case of someone using this law to request access to a Steam account, but just because the law has not been tested in a specific way, it does not mean that such a request is unlikely to succeed. At the moment it is much easier to just give your password to your family instead of going through a long legal process, but it is only a matter of time before this  problem reaches the courts as gamers age, making digital inheritance a bigger issue. The process of transferring a Steam account might be expensive due to legal fees and you might need a court order if Valve is uncooperative but you should remember that if you live in America, as long as you make sure to consult a lawyer and include clear instructions regarding your digital assets in your will, you are not powerless.

I have included some links to pages which explain RUFADAA in more detail as well as which states the law has been passed in. If digital inheritance is something you care about I really suggest you give them a read.

I immediately had a suspicion that it's either an error or just a mistake, from somebody who didn't really look the account. Yet looking into it I came to a conclusion, that it has to be an error. The question was, how did it happen? The only reason I could remember of (yes, remember) was that i accidentally left my account logged on a PC in my school. Yet it sounds weird here is my theory: i believe, that the computer confused the files of my account and another one, due to mistakes in file system. Is there anyone that can confirm this? Now that I'm writing this it seems as the games were gifted to me by some user I don't know, yet if games were accidentally put onto my account, how did the user not check for the name? My friend immediately suspected that this was done intentionally, to trick me into buying all the games and worse my addiction. I'm addicted btw, yet it's manageble. Either way accident or intention, when i checked the games WERE purchased ALREADY! 

If anyone has already encountered this, please inform me. What i did for now was log out of all devices and remove all games i knew i didn't buy from my account.

Also please share this to prevent anything like this from happening.

When I bought the deck form a guy locally who had it brought over form Germany it came with this USB hub for docking. I use it but I always feel uncomfortable because if I have the power adapter plugged into the USB C Port the hug itself gets very hot.

What worries me is that even tho I've had the deck for months now, yesterday after a longer docked session it got that white border around the screen, this thing:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/123mlq8/white\_edges\_around\_my\_screen/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/123mlq8/white_edges_around_my_screen/)

It went away and it's fine now but I don't know if maybe it was caused by the HUB?

One specific and annoying thing about the hub is I have to first connect the controller (I use an Xbox controller) to one of the USB 3 ports and then connect the power adapter to the USB C Port else the controller doesn't work.

I can buy other hubs locally just not any of the Steam Deck 3rd party docks, much less an official dock because Valve despite having full support for Macedonia when it comes to the Steam store it does not sell the deck or accessories here",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1d12lb4/s_this_usb_c_hub_with_hdmi_safe_to_use_as_a/

zyberteq,idea: Financial motivation for publishers to be good,6,2024-05-25 20:20:27+00:00,"Ever since I got my steamdeck, I've been getting more and more annoyed with extra requirements in games, e.g.: DRM, 3rd party launcher (a.k.a. publisher shops), separate accounts, etc. And I've tried to think of ways to entice publishers to actually not do that on steam, since Valve isn't going to require that from them, because they would probably all stop publishing on Steam.

So I came up with financial bonuses for them in the form of extra revenue. So there would be a number of bonus ""features"" a publisher/developer could add (or omit) where they would get, for example, 2% extra revenue per sale on top of what they already get. e.g.:

* No 3rd party DRM
* No always online for single player
* No 3rd party launcher
* No  separate user account required
* Platinum ProtonDB score/Verified (persistent) steamdeck support
* LAN option/dedicated server for multiplayer games

We could combine a few (probably smart), add some more?

andrew1520,Steam No Longer Lets You Set Custom Libraries. ,18,2024-05-26 03:08:50+00:00,"As the title says, seems like steam no longer allows you too choose a steam library location, so you cant simply click your old steam library folder and use your old game files, you have to transfer every single file from one location to another. Seems like a stupid issue, but its pretty annoying considering it was a feature, and they've taken it away for no apparent reason. 

Would their be any good reason to get rid of this? It was one of the nice things about steam, and it seemed like other gaming launchers were picking up on it, so for steam to get rid of it just makes no sense to me. 

Editted Conclusion: You can no longer select add a folder location steam/settings/downloads, it seems to default to (driveletter)\steamlibrary instead. The one comment mentioned being able to edit the steam files to have more libraries, I am not sure if this works, but I linked a tutorial explaining the process. 
What I ended up doing was copying my folder ""d\Games and Launchers\steamlibrary"" to d\steamlibrary. Then under steam I deleted d drive as a library, then added it as a library, and it found all of my games. That being said it would most likely be smarter to copy your ""steamlibrary"" folder  directly to the drive you want to use, before selecting the drive as a library under steam. This way you wouldnt be deleting the library like I did, which may cause issues. 

Hopefully this helps someone.

Edit number 2: It turns out the option is still there. When you click add drive, click the drop down menu, then let me choose another location. Thanks for everyone's help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1d0s8m8/steam_no_longer_lets_you_set_custom_libraries/

I already searched a lot but can not find the right answer. Maybe some experts can help me?

Button A should trigger ""Command 1""
Button B should trigger ""Command 2""

But when pressing A+B both together this should trigger ""Command 3""

Background:
I will try to use the Backpaddels of a 3rd Party Controller. But these Backpaddels are only for Combinations and not configurable via Steam.
So my Controller can Bind whatever Buttons I want to the Backpaddels, but nothing else.

When I assign something strange what I will never need, eh. right Stick click + B
maybe I can tell Steam that this Combination will trigger a special command.

This way I can use the 3rd Party Backpaddels as additional Buttons and can assign everything I want via Steam Input ;-)

Hopefully this will work,... but I need some help assigning a Combination of two or three Buttons to one single Command, without loosing the command of each Button (when pressed allone).

It was natural and easy making friends during the 2010-2016 period when I was young. Now I can barely strike a conversation with anyone and find it weird and creepy to just mass add anyone who chats with me.

However, fortunately, today I clicked with a few players from a certain game that I play often and they added me.

It's a long story, but I haven't gamed seriously since 2016 and the few friends that I had left all left me due to drama or my (or their) toxicity. Some grew cold and moved on, some fought with me over silly drama and left me, some just deleted me out of the blue.

I am now in my mid 20s and I've returned to gaming. My life isn't really that smooth so sometimes I feel bitter and always find myself slipping and complaining/being toxic.

I am very happy that I managed to make a few friends today and I want to strengthen that friendship so we can chit chat and gossip about current events, set up matches, and have fun. But I don't have the natural skill to do that anymore like when I was a teen.

Graphically, everything is different, okay, whatever. I'll just navigate it. But there's so. much. broken on the current beta build(needed for certain gyro settings).

Minor stuff: 

On-Screen Keyboard: the twin stick keyboard is just...gone? Arguably the best on screen keyboard for making typing stuff without a keyboard not miserable.

Switch controller's A button is mapped to the XInput A button by default for some reason, which is odd because this is only a Steam thing, games and emulators that have drivers to support switch controllers don't do this.

Menus Just look obtuse with everything organized in long lists, and having to press select/option/whatever-its-called to actually see the controller, it should just default to this view.

And the most objectionable part of the menu design

[What would you name the button on the right?](https://preview.redd.it/64r36dzz6f2d1.png?width=289&format=png&auto=webp&s=5920e696402994c6d1e0eaaf5b1e8818478a5698)

this is unnecessarily confusing, a cog wheel is usually the settings right? Well it is here too, its just different settings from the 'edit' button's settings. Could these not be on the same screen?

Major stuff:

https://preview.redd.it/ojb2dpiw5f2d1.png?width=527&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c048e1a46e7ceb2a3a30b8d6c182e87c9ca1c64

For some reason you just can't select Joystick for the Joysticks, chalking this up to beta version glitches

There's no 'confirm' button for any of these menus, you just press the back button. This is a problem when the editor sometimes doesn't reflect changes, or sometimes those changes just don't work - cue me opening the ""Gyro Activation Button"" menu 50 times -.

What does the Reddit Steam community think about Steam Cloud evolving and become not only a games/data/profile/screenshot backup but a full fledged game streaming service? 

The idea would still be to purchase the game as usual but they could offer a service like GeForce now but no where near as clunky to use (scanning QR codes to get in, looks like a remote desktop situation) but functioned with the smoothness of Stadia and offered either one quality stream or 3 quality tiers for different prices? I think it would do great as GFN doesn't have every game on it and logging in, etc seems archaic. 

Again, you don't have to use the streaming as you could still download and play the game locally BUT can finally play every game at max settings wherever there's a browser without having to use another app like GFN or Shadow PC.

spikereloaded,Adding to my infinite Backlog...feels good?!,3,2024-05-23 14:31:02+00:00,"I saw a comment the other day somewhere that summed up my current approach to gaming, particularly on the Steam Deck.

""Sometimes I think I prefer buying games, to actually playing them""

When I saw that, it just clicked with me straight away. And it's weird because I hate spending money!  
As a father to a young one and working two jobs, whilst also trying to be healthy and good a husband, I rarely get time to play games for any length of time these days, and when I do get the opportunity, often I can't decide what I'm in the mood to play and end up playing nothing in the end.

The Steam deck has helped with this a lot as it's so convenient to pick up and put down quickly, but I still find myself, when turning on my PC, going straight to Steam and before opening a game, I look at what other new games I might like to add to my ever increasing backlog of uncompleted games that I'll someday get around to playing! The Steam Deck makes it even easier to build up my Backlog as I can do it from the couch!

At times, the idea of finding a well reviewed game at a steal of a price, is in itself, the game I end up playing. and once the purchase button has been hit and I have spent the almost insignificant sum of no more than £7 on a 3 year old game, the prospect of actually playing it feels like a bit of a chore.

Anyone else feel this way at times or am I just boring dad gamer now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cyu6zi/adding_to_my_infinite_backlogfeels_good/

When I got the RMA, I confirmed with Steam Support that I wouldn't be responsible for any costs related to the repair and it was shipped to the USA for repair. However, now that it's on it's way back, UPS shows a $79.44 brokerage fee for the shipment that I'm apparently responsible for. I called UPS and disputed it but they checked and claim the fee is correct and gave me no further recourse to dispute it. I believe that this law ([https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d8/d8-2-10-eng.html](https://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/publications/dm-md/d8/d8-2-10-eng.html) see item 6) prohibits them from charging me for the return of a repaired item, but they don't agree. I'm waiting to hear back from Steam Support about it, but just a warning to anyone else who might be in the same situation. An aftermarket back panel for the Deck would've been cheaper than this and I wouldn't have been without my device for 3 weeks...

EDIT: Just to wrap this up, I finally got a reply back from Steam Support and they're looking into getting the charges moved to their UPS account.

collonnelo,Best way to game on PC but stream on the TV?,4,2024-05-22 14:53:54+00:00,"Hey, so after the Fallout TV show I started playing Fallout4 again and I usually do it while I'm on a Discord Date with my long distance GF. I started replaying the game streaming it to her through discord and she got pretty hooked on it after I made the Main Character named and modeled after her. She's been loving the story and action so far and we've been doing this pretty regularly for the past few weeks. 

Issue is that she is coming over to visit soon and she wants to continue watching me game. The reason this is an issue is because I game on my desktop PC and while I have 2 screens, they're not really suitable to play and show her what's going on simultaneously. 

Potential solution is that I have a TV that directly faces my TV which is what I know she would like to do. Lay in bed watching me play as I game on my PC. But I believe both my HDMI ports on my GPU are occupied connected to my two monitors.

 I know a decent solution is to simply unplug one and hook up a super long cable from the PC to the TV but I am looking to see if anyone knows a potentially better or easier solution. One that ideally allows me to still use both my monitors and stream to the TV. I think a Chromecast would work well but I've heard there can be issues with latency. But I'm assuming this is more if I was actually gaming with the TV instead of streaming onto it. 

Any input would be appreciated! Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cy26qd/best_way_to_game_on_pc_but_stream_on_the_tv/

Honest-af_account,Do you prefer old or new library sharing method?,6,2024-05-21 17:38:54+00:00,"In the new family sharing method, you can no longer share libraries with people outside of the ""family"" you're joined into.

Meaning if a friend of mine, wanna use the libraries in our family, he can join, but he'll no longer be able to use the library of his ***other*** friend that I don't know who they are, and doubt they'd be interested in joining *\*our\** ""family"", if there's even a slot left.

However on the bright side, in the new method there is no full library lockdown just because the owner is using one of his games/software.

So it's actually a trade-off.

You get to use the same library simultaneously in the same family, but there's less flexibility in choosing which people to share libraries with or from.

In fact, this change proves that valve is perfectly capable of making it such that you're not locked out of the whole library just cuz owner is using a single game from it.

So why not, just, implement that, into the old method of library sharing?

I see no issue, the old method wasn't really that exploitable, and the only real issue with it was the full library lockdown from a single game. So if this new method doesn't have that issue, what's stopping valve from fixing this issue in the old method instead? Why not choose the good traits of both methods, and come up with the best superior library sharing feature?

I recently added Minecraft onto Steam so I can use the controller support (I struggle A LOT trying to use a keyboard and mouse, to the point that I won't play if I have to use them). However, the keyboard configurations wouldn't transfer into the game. I included a screenshot of the settings, but when I open the game, the right joystick and the B button are the only ones that work. Joystick has the sensitivity jacked way up for looking around, and B makes me jump. I tried playing with the settings to no avail, so I hopped over to Stardew only to find that the settings over there no longer work, and the joystick and B are the only ones that work, albeit with messed up functions.

I'm completely out of ideas for what to do. I've set custom controls, downloaded community controls, toggled steam input on and off, and played with every available controller setting to see if something would happen to do anything.

UnicornInvisiblePink,A Hitchhiker's Guide to Get Cheaper Steam Games,2,2024-05-21 01:08:43+00:00,"1. Buying game on Steam directly

This is the most convenient way, but even historical low price is often not the cheapest. You can find the historical low price on [steamdb.info](https://steamdb.info), but it's more convenient with [augmented steam](https://augmentedsteam.com/), a browser extension available for chrome, firefox, and edge.

2. Keys

Keys are usually cheaper, especially when you don’t wanna wait another two months until next Steam sale. However, keys have two drawbacks-- 1. It’s much much harder to refund the key if you don't like it.  2. Your game can be revoked if your key seller obtains the key illegitimately. [isthereanydeal.com](https://isthereanydeal.com) is an excellent website to look for key sellers-- it summarizes all the legitimate key sellers and also compares their prices.

3. Bundles

Bundles are insanely cheaper, but there is no guarantee what will show up in the bundle. What can be guaranteed is that recently released game won't be in the bundle. My favorite bundle is Europa Universalis 4 bundle, which includes most dlcs of EU4, whose historical low prices add up to $90 but the bundle only costs $20. The bundle websites I currently use are humble bundle and fanatical.

4. Free to claim games

These are not free games; they are just free to grab in a limited time. You can keep them forever in your library, but there'll be no card drops. Free to claim games can be found here: [https://steamdb.info/upcoming/free/](https://steamdb.info/upcoming/free/). Currently 100% orange juice, endless legend, Machinika Museum are free to claim. All of them are decent games. 

&#x200B;

ps1. illegitimate keys: for example, scammers will send emails to devs, saying they'll review the game if the devs send them a few keys. These keys will show up on g2a soon, and devs can revoke the keys if they find it out. You can avoid this by only buying keys on legitimate website. 

ps2. if you write a review for the game activated by key, it won't count towards the review count.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cwvqoj/a_hitchhikers_guide_to_get_cheaper_steam_games/

My issue is this:
Battle.net games and big picture mode/ controller don’t play well together. I can add battle.net as a non steam game and get the controller to work for the launcher, however I can’t use the same controller input for games as it won’t track the buttons correctly. When I open D2R it still stays in desktop mode and doesn’t let the native D2R controller support take over. If I add d2R as a non steam game, I can boot directly to d2R and skip the launcher so native controller support works.

The game itself does not require you to sign in, only if you want to play the Legends mode, which is multiplayer, or use the new overlay. Then, why restrict the game itself just for a game mode?

I have a great suggestion to make, because while I completely understand the mandatory use of a PS account to play the multiplayer mode, I feel sad for all the countries that can't even enjoy the single player game. So, what it should be done is put the Legends mode as a DLC, that way it can be treated as a separate product in the store, and that DLC is the one that should be region locked, but not the base game.

What I don't understand is why no one working at Sony and making decisions thought of that.

I ask this because steam is basically a monopoly, so even if game companies don't like it, what are they going to do? They can make their own launcher but most probably wouldn't go through the hassle just to pay for Denuvo.

I know epic games launcher exists, but I don't think I've heard a single person who actually liked it. Like I only have it for the kingdom hearts collection, same with rockstar launcher

I really say this because I wanna see what companies would do in a theoretical situation like this. Would they really pull out of steam or would they suck it up. I'm tired of this anti consumer BS, let's make something anti business for once. 

Edit: Ok I should probably clerify two things.

1. I'm mainly bringing this up because we're in the age of portable PCs that can go anywhere internet or not, which now comes with the problem of not being able to connect with denuvos servers. I was doing training for two weeks in an area without any internet. I didn't realize I couldn't play half my games like sonic origins or persona 5 strikers until I got the lovely ""go online to play"" thing when opening the app.

2. Yes I said monopoly, Im mainly saying this because sure, every company can make their own launcher and shit, but how many launchers will it take till there's a breaking point? People already hate EGS, EA Launcher, Ubisofts dumb thing, hell I hate the GTA launcher but I still have to use it.

Am I really being petty when I can't play the game I paid for? I'm just an average consumer, I didn't exactly know all the INS and outs of Denuvo till I had half my library on my PC with a wired Ethernet connection. It's too late to vote with my wallet now, which means I have to now do it in the future.

Rewendor,"Steam partnered up with local company after pricing changes to Dollars from local currency. Local firm overprices purchases, Steam tickets get ignored.",63,2024-05-19 07:55:47+00:00,"**Update 23.05.24:** Great news: After my post Steam contacted me. It seems a credit card processor was using another routing. Hopefully they will fix it soon. Thank you all for the support. 

**TLDR upfront:** Steam changes from local currency to USD in my country. Not complaining about that. However Steam partners up a with a third party firm for transactions. This firm extremely overcharges the pricing (ca. +10%). When created the ticket, unfortunately Steam ticket response was awful, they didn't even read the ticket, sent only automatic responses.

So, this is a bit hard to explain. I am an active Steam user since 15 or so years at last. In my country, in the last years Steam was selling games in our own currency. However, due to the fluctuation in the economy, recently Steam unfortunately changed to US dollars for pricing. It was a sad day for us local gamers, since the prices went up incredibly, but understandable and a business decision. I will not complain about that here, but what happened afterwards.

As we discovered, Steam partnered up with a local third party firm for money transactions. Whenever I buy a game from Steam now, one of the two options happen:

1. Steam charges regular $ price from my credit card. My bank decides the the exchange rate and reflects it to my card in local currency. (currently ca. 2% above regular exchange rate). This is the normal way of  international purchase
2. Instead of Steam, a local partner company of Steam (called Lidio) directly charges my credit card in local currency, with an extreme exchange rate (+10%). That means: I pay 110$ for a supposedly 100$ transaction (in other words, I pay for an extra Indie game I don't get).

Until now we in local gaming community could not understand when which option happens (not dependent on game publisher, purchase time or price it self as far as we checked). So there is always a random possibility that I will be overcharged.

I tried to solve this with Steam (just get them talk to their partners to regulate the pricing to an acceptable level). Unfortunately after my first ticket after ca 2 decades of Steam usage, I found out that Steam help was not helpful at all. Whoever responded my tickets did not read my ticket at all, responded to some keywords in my message (not the issue itself at all) and closed down the ticket without asking if it is solved. The responses were like ""Steam is not responsible with your banks exchange rate, it is your problem, talk to your bank"" (It is Steam's partner not mine and it's not a bank) or ""Your refund is rejected"" (I didn't ask for any refund). With a very unpolite ""I close the ticket, if you have more problems open a new one"".

Is it only specific to my country? Does Steam have partners in other countries for purchases as well? Is the pricing from third party always this high? How to get Steam listen to this and maybe also talk to their partners for reasonable pricing? To be honest recently only because of this reason I cancelled a few purcheses. Not that I cannot afford a few extra bucks, but because I don't like this feeling of being ""scammed"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cvj5be/steam_partnered_up_with_local_company_after/

ManlySyrup,PSA: Valve added deadzones to every Steam Input controller with a Client update and it's messing up racing/fps games. Here's how to fix.,25,2024-05-18 20:15:35+00:00,"An update released on May 16th reverted a change Valve had made to Steam a while back, where every game by default had no deadzone at all, which was a very welcome change from the original settings where every game had a massive deadzone on the inner and outer areas of both sticks.

Now, for some reason, Valve reverted that change and we are now back to the original settings and all games have deadzones now. What's worse is that there's no setting to completely disable the deadzones globally so you have to change them back for every game individually.

TEMPORARY FIX:

Go to any game's details page and click the controller icon on the right side (next to the cog icon), then go to Edit Layout, then Joystick, then click on the cog icon next to the joysticks (cause you need to change both), then go to Deadzone, and then change it from ""Default Size' to ""Custom"". Then you are going to drag the sliders so that they are at [0 and 100](https://imgur.com/w9Y2ndC), to fully remove the deadzone. You have to do this for both joysticks, for every single game in your library, one by one.

Alternatively, if you have an Xbox controller that doesn't need it, disable Steam Input altogether.

Thanks Valve, very nice.

UPDATE: Valve issued a [new update](https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/6954198761960277043) on the Beta Channel reverting these changes!

I VERY casually gamed on Xbox, playing Fallout 4, Fortnite, Minecraft, and Starfield, amid some other games and I’d like to play those kinds of games but in a more portable way. 

What should I know before joining the Steam community in layman’s terms?

If I’m looking for portability would a Nintendo switch be more my speed? 

I’ll be happy to answer any clarifying questions, thanks in advance!

Got a steam deck recently and im loving it. Really going hard with Fallout 4 and sitting not the couch to play is great. But there are times where I wish to dock the deck using the steamdock. However the Fullscreen mode doesnt work due to the next gen update, so it doesnt scale to 1920 x 1080p.

I have heard that changing the launch options can rectify this by allowing me to access the setting in to change the game to windowed which will resolve it. However I have read somethings where achievements are then removed?

Like recently, I got myself Ghost of Tsushima and as I'm not so worried (atm) about linking my steam to PSN, I create a new id on PSN and linked them. Started a bit of the multiplayer part and I didn't like my ID so I went I tried changing it. 

TO my freaking surprise PSN notified me that the first change is free but your next change would be chargeable and I'm like WTF? you charge for changing usernames now? 

And I looked over the internet and realized this is a common thing on xbox or battlenet, like seriously and gamers are just taking it? Can't they see how good steam's policy is, have a shitty username but they allow you to change your alias which is what everyone sees, and it's free to change as many freaking times you want.

Nikitoo,The Helldivers 2 situation screwed over the PSN unsupported countries,20,2024-05-17 13:21:36+00:00,"First of all, I know this will get a lot of hate as people for some reason are completely unsympathetic if they’re not the ones being affected.

Many of us PSN owners in unsupported countries were able to use PSN normally by setting the address to somewhere else so we weren’t really affected by the Helldivers 2 PSN requirement. People were blatantly lying during the last few days saying if u make a PSN account with another country you would get banned by Sony but this was completely not true. I’m from Egypt and the majority of gamers here use a playstation as their platform of gaming. Sony has never once taken action regarding making a PSN from a different country but i kept seeing people falsely saying they were getting banned for doing it.

What was the end result of this? Helldivers 2 backed down and said the game won’t require PSN but didn’t enforce it as of yet. Additionally, they delisted the game from 170~ regions. GoT just released with 170~ regions restricted as well from even buying it.

How is this a win for anyone? When things didn’t change and in-fact got worse.

I see GoT rated as very positive ATM on Steam (i had to use a VPN to even access it btw) so it seems everyone has forgotten. I thought the whole idea of the Helldivers 2 controversy is that DRM is awful and that all gamers should be able to play the game equally. Both of those are still an issue to this day for both Helldivers 2 and GoT (and possibly any Sony game in the future).

It just seems like to me as long as people aren’t personally affected by the delisting they don’t give a fuck. The biggest evidence of that is whenever someone speaks negatively about the delisting nowadays they get downvoted and gets replies along the lines of “damn, sucks to be you”

TheSchlooper,Steam's Brave to have User Reviews so close to the Buy Button,22,2024-05-16 21:32:45+00:00,"I tend to browse around games on steam quite frequently when I'm just hanging out with my buddies in Discord, and it's always interesting to see how transparent Steam is compared to other platforms. I looked at Uplay/GOG/Epic Games and Origin store fronts and none of them give the power to the players as much as Steam does. The one that barely comes close would be GOG as it gives a space for player reviews at the very bottom, but that's really it in comparison.  
Just another weird social part of Steam platform's ability to leave reviews on products where the review score is entirely in the peoples hands, and yet it directly affects entities and their investors' opinions on them. Competitors platforms don't really let you leave a more or less unfiltered opinion about a game the way Steam does. It's pretty cool though - like you go to a movie theatre and when you're buying your ticket, you're not immediately presented with a bunch of reviews of the movie before you pay to see it. You go to a restaurant and you don't see the reviews right before you make your order (usually).

But on Steam, right on the same page where you click buy, you see metrics they provide for you in the same glance.

Let's take Destiny 2 on Steam and on Epic Games Store for example.

[Destiny 2 on Steam](https://preview.redd.it/sgp76vdlsu0d1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4181ce44be095f6cb0de9af1614eccfaca911cd)

Your experience when ""buying"" or ""choosing to play"" Destiny 2 on steam is very closely placed next to the review score. Not only does it include a worded version of how positive the reviews are, but it also includes the review count, sorted by Recent and Overall scores.  


Compare this to Epic Games storefront:  


[Destiny 2 on Epic Games Store](https://preview.redd.it/2rw9d716tu0d1.png?width=1335&format=png&auto=webp&s=62798b64c8f78dd46c9d2a7254d2863c8b9a8568)

Not only is it totally further away, but also includes drastically less information. To even get more information on how the overall opinion is, you'd have to scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page to see how many reviews are given.

[More information about Destiny 2 on EGS](https://preview.redd.it/dzaq1r9btu0d1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a312e129400dbc9aee43a8f5b927882ad131383)

&#x200B;

Even then, the information isn't even necessarily by gamers on the Epic Games Store, as they are outsourced by *OpenCritic*  and leaving a review on said site would require a player to make an account and go through all that process just to leave their opinion. That makes the reviews generally curated by those who's career is to leave reviews to begin with.  


The other cool thing is that Steam actually lets you leave a review on EVERY purchase, not just the main title.  


Like how on Epic, you can't review the Shadowkeep Expansion of Destiny 2  


[Destiny 2: Shadowkeep on EGS, with no review score](https://preview.redd.it/qgdmxgqttu0d1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d0c5e847f5e6fa1321fa280cc8ccbeaf799240e)

&#x200B;

Yet on Steam, you can see how poorly  received this particular expansion was:  


[Destiny 2: Shadowkeep on Steam, review scores included.](https://preview.redd.it/ofi5bggwtu0d1.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f5518b491657bf48a7418616b76f5ceb62a967e)

mabdog420,How can I prevent steam from opening Big Picture Mode when pressing the home/guide button on a controller?,4,2024-05-15 16:51:28+00:00,"I've searched long and hard for a solution to this problem, but after watching countless YouTube videos and reading through years of forum posts nothing has worked for me.

Before I breakdown what I've tried so far, I will offer a small disclaimer: I have been successful in disabling big picture mode on guide button press, but the only method that works for me is to disable steam input completely. This will be my last resort, as I would really like to use some of the steam input features.. but forcing me to open big picture mode when I press the home button is just not gonna work for me.

It's absolutely insane to me that this feature is forced upon you if you want to use the steam inputs feature.


So the common ""fixes"" for this are:

1. Change all settings under ""controller"" and ""in game"" that pertain to big picture mode. 
Off the top of my head these settings were things like ""focus steam when pressing the guide button"" and ""use big picture mode for controller""

I disabled every setting I could find that has anything to do with big picture mode and this fixes nothing.
The guide button still opens Big Picture Mode.

2. Go to controller > begin test
Now go through the process of setting up all inputs and deliberately skip the home/guide input.

This also just didn't work for me. 
The guide button still opens Big Picture Mode.

I was about to just delete steam entirely until I found out how to disable steam input for controller.

Still, steam inputs have some really nice features, like virtual menus and input mapping for shortcuts and other things that I would really like to be able to use. Why is this so incredibly difficult to change? Shouldn't there just be a setting where I can choose what the guide button does? Why does steam have to force big picture mode on its users?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1csplje/how_can_i_prevent_steam_from_opening_big_picture/

Basically if I play some games from a desktop shortcut in windows (in this instance it’s dead island 1) then the game runs at a locked 100fps, smooth as butter and it runs perfectly.

But if I add this shortcut to steam and boot it from big picture mode then the game has massive frame pacing issues even though it’s still showing as a 100fps lock in graphs.

Surely steam in this instance is just booting the .exe and not doing anything else with the game so what’s causing the difference in performance here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1csqk6i/what_does_steam_do_different_when_booting_games/

Me and my dad have always been gamers together. We made YouTube videos and played together and all that. When I got a laptop, he just put his Steam account on it so he could manage it easier and know what I was doing. As I grew up, we just continued sharing that account. We both had spent money on it, and it was easy to work out different times for each of us to play each day. However, I now live with my mom half of the time. It’s become hard to work out our schedules together and split up our gaming time. I’m wondering if there’s a way to maybe create two different accounts to share the games or anything possible to let us play our library simultaneously.

Poczatkujacymodelarz,Steam prices in Poland. This is the result of some half an hour research in google and some calculations in excell. Please treat it more like an example of a situation and not like a serious statistical data (because it isn't).,13,2024-05-14 12:56:55+00:00,"As you can see below, I have compared average salaries and cost of living to the cost of games on Steam based on RDR2 (price is slightly lower than average new AAA game). As you can see, prices are almost identical, even though economic differences are huge. I've included comments in the table. 

Obviously, average person is not really an adequate representation of the overall population, but for simplicity reasons I have used averages here. With current prices, an average polish person can buy one copy of RDR2 after covering the costs of living. At the same time, a german person can buy 16 copies, and norwegian person can buy 46 copies. 

Conclusion - living in Poland is suffering, and you can't really game it away because you cannot afford games.

I have a lot of questions I cant explain and I'm thinking of wanting one if I can do said things so if anyone has any tips about it or information like the questions I asked before, that would help. 
Thank you for taking the time to read and if or help, I feel embarrassed of how much I'm on the help Reddit for small things (*´∇`)ﾉ. I apologize sincerely if this isn't supposed to be here but I just wanna know before I buy something. 

❗Edit: thank you everyone who answered my questions and gave me tips! I very much appreciate it. As little as this edit will probably mean, I'm still grateful.

Shadowcommando9,I’m thinking of moving to PC but I have some questions.,8,2024-05-13 17:02:52+00:00,"Microsoft and Sony recent shenanigans has been making me thinking about owning a prebuilt pc or steam deck and moving to steam but as console player I have questions.

Can I transfer all of my purchased and save data games from Xbox to steam I own a lot of games on my Xbox and I hate having to start all over again with games I spent hours on and having to buy and do all over again so there a way I can transfer my library of games into steam?

Can the steam deck run games on 60fps really good and how many games can it download?

What is the best prebuilt PC on Amazon or other websites? If you say I should build one myself no I will not because I’m stupid and lazy.

Are there PCs that are easy to use or are they all complicated?

>Following Sony's decision last week to delist Helldivers 2 in 170 regions worldwide on Steam, it seems this will be the firm's PC stance moving forward, and it has since done the same for the imminent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima. More regions have been added to the list, taking the total number of territories affected to 180, which is now consistent across both titles.  
>  
>Previously, Sony had said that Ghost of Tsushima's single player offering would be unaffected by this additional requirement. The game's Steam page still states that a PSN account is required to play the Legends multiplayer mode, but it was delisted anyway. Due to the open nature of Valve's platform, these changes are pretty visible, and including Sucker Punch's primarily single player open world epic in this blanket ban comes as a legitimate surprise.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cr0n49/sony_delists_ghost_of_tsushima_pc_from_steam/

I also feel like Valve's pricing is usually very competitive, barring the Index which had a steep price. A new Steam controller would probably not come with Dualsense-level tech but would be on the cheaper side. Thoughts?

Kpt_Squirrel,Allow reviews for publishers on Steam,5,2024-05-12 21:26:03+00:00,"I am taking this from a negative review on Kerbal Space Program 2 (which has recently had a landslide on negative reviews) by user DJKnights. Steam should add a feature on rating publishers!

What is so great about this idea is that it would incentivise publishers (and/ or developers) to pursue good actions. It encourages competition from publishers, not on pricing like traditionally, but on customer service and game quality.

Now, I can already hear people saying ""well, sure, but everyone is just going to downvote all triple-A studios because every triple-A studio sucks!"". I think a fair solution to this is to categorise all triple-A studios into a single leaderboard where you don't see (or see at the same time) their actual up-to-down-review ratio but instead see where they are placed in relation to other studios. This would prevent most studios from getting unfairly reviewbombed.

Building onto that, it would be helpful to show a rolling 30- or 90-day review result which would help customers to get a feeling on how well a particular studio has been doing recently.

I'm curious if there are others who think this is a good idea!

Help!!! I tried to open up steam and load bg3 just now. And when I click to launch, it says there is a ""cloud conflict"". There are two save files that come up when I try to launch. One from yesterday around 5p.m (which, I had definitely played a few times yesterday after 5p.m and remember saving. I save often anyway...) and the other says it's a ""local save""  from this morning around 10:30a.m when I quick saved, and then quit the game to close my laptop and take it to work with me. I accidentally fell asleep with the game up anf running last night. This is something I do often (bad, I know) but I've NEVER had an issue like this before! 

I saw online that apparently clicking the wrong save fil can either delete all ypur progress/saved files or replace them Wil older save files.. I am just about to enter act 3. I REALLY don't want to lose my progress and important saves. This is my first playthrough. So sll my filed are super important to me!! 

What do I do?! When I try to ""re-sync"" my filed it doesn't even seem to attempt to retry and just gives me the same ""unable to sunc"" alert under ""cloud status"" on steam.

AnalysingAgent3676,Let's be clear ... Steam Big Picture UI is not the same as Steam OS Gaming Mode,13,2024-05-12 16:37:56+00:00,"Whenever someone says they prefer Steam OS over Windows, there are always a few people who will jump up and say use Steam Big Picture UI in Windows, and you'll have the same experience. While Big Picture UI does provide some of the elements to a proper gaming mode, it does not do everything.

[Steam OS screenshot: Entering point A and point B may result in the same UI but they are different](https://preview.redd.it/tefnqujzw00d1.png?width=1907&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c491c9f3a5979862df4c6b61403bdfc3299d1e)

Steam OS screenshot: Entering point A and point B may result in the same UI but they are different

Steam OS = Desktop Mode (with Desktop Steam & Big Picture UI Steam) + Gaming Mode

Windows OS = Desktop mode (with Desktop Steam & Big Picture UI Steam) with NO Gaming Mode

Steam OS has a gaming mode that achieves the following while WIndows does not:

1. It cannot be exited by ALT+F4 and exiting the mode is much more intentional by going to the exit to desktop option, and therefore cannot have focus taken away from its window because it is not a window
2. Provides a full screen UI that is controllable with a controller
3. Launches one game/app at a time
4. Launches the game/app in full screen mode only, no need for windowed apps
5. Stops processes not relevant to gaming but allows the advanced user to force run desktop processes in gaming mode if they choose
6. Prioritises processes for gaming over other processes

Windows does not have a gaming mode like Steam OS does, however there have been strong hints, rumours and exec comments that suggest that something is coming. See links below.

With a dedicated gaming mode for Windows (similar to Steam OS gaming mode), other than the lower price and touchpads of the steam deck, I would argue that device like the ROG ally and MSI claw (and maybe the Legion Go if you like big handhands) and possibly future devices from the other gaming laptop manufacturers, Dell/Alienware and HP, could beat the SteamDeck. After all, these Windows based Handhelds are also more powerful than steam deck now with more compatible games, but Windows is missing that gaming mode to complete the experience

The one extra thing that a Windows gaming mode will need that a steam os gaming mode doesn't need, is ability to switch between game stores/launchers - we wouldn't want windows gaming mode to be just a gaming mode for Xbox games on PC. Their gaming mode needs to support Steam, Epic, GOG, EA, Xbox for PC and even platforms like ""Google play games for PC"" and ""Emulation station"". These platforms would need to be updated by the developers to work with any gaming mode that Microsoft puts out for Windows. Right now, only steam and Emulation station have a controller based interface, so the rest will need to update.

Hints that a Windows Gaming Mode could come to Windows in the future ...

Chemical_Mode_7909,"Steam hasn't updated regional pricing for two years, so Polish gamers are fighting for it",5,2024-05-12 07:00:17+00:00,"If some of you get money back after buying Hades II it's because of a movement that happened among Polish gamers. Games in Poland that use prices suggested by Steam cost approximately 10% more compared to the rest of the world, and after our response, the developers of some games lowered their prices. Supergiant reduced the price of Hades 2 from 139 PLN to 117 PLN and gave back 22 PLN (15% of the original price) to players who bought the game before this price lowering. And the same thing happened today in ukrainian region!

This is a very important topic that should be taken up by players from other parts of the world, because not only Poland is struggling with unfair game pricing. But since I'm taking my country as an example, let me outline what actually happened.

In October 2022, Steam adjusted its recommended regional pricing, impacting regions outside the US dollar zone, including Poland. This coincided with a period where the Polish zloty (PLN) experienced a notable decline in purchasing power. Consequently, Polish gamers faced price hikes of up to 28%, with game prices rising, for example, from 214.99 zł to 274.99 zł. While the PLN later stabilized, Valve, the company behind Steam, failed to update the pricing for nearly two years, although it was announced that they would do it regularly. The exchange rate used in 2022 is no longer aligned with the current rate, leading to Polish gamers paying some of the highest prices globally for PC games. For instance, titles like Hades II were significantly more expensive in Poland compared to Eurozone countries like Germany. This discrepancy, though seemingly minor per purchase, becomes significant given Poland's substantial demand for PC games. The issue extends beyond independent titles, affecting major releases like Forza Motorsport, where Polish gamers pay 349 PLN compared to approximately 300.50 PLN in the Eurozone, representing a 14% disparity. Despite improvements in Poland's economy, average earnings still trail behind Eurozone countries, resulting in Polish PC players bearing a disproportionate burden of game costs compared to their European counterparts.

The largest gaming websites in Poland are trying to publicize this problem and the effects are already visible. Polish players have united and for several days now they have been in contact with Steam representatives and the creators of games whose prices are higher than in other European Union countries. They send email, use Twitter and discussions on Steam itself for this purpose. The thread about the price of Hades 2 in Poland collected over 500 comments. After the response from Polish players, several studios lowered the prices of their games. Right now we can buy cheaper games like mentioned Hades II, Felvidek, Hellish Quart, Vertigo 2, Little Kitten, Big City, Door Kickers 2, and the list is only getting longer. The creators of No Rest for the Wicked, which is the most expensive in the world in Poland, promised to raise the issue of the game's price with the publisher. We can, and we should, raise the issue of unfair and outdated game prices in Poland and other regions. Every price disparity is visible on SteamDB in games such as Starfield, Palworld, Dave the Diver, Gray Zone Warfare, Total War Warhammer 3, Project Zomboid, and a lot more.

I encourage all gamers from less economically developed countries to pay attention to the pricing of games in their regions. There is a very good chance that you are paying much more for games on Steam than you should, and it is worth contacting Valve and the developers of games that use an outdated price converter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cq1wvr/steam_hasnt_updated_regional_pricing_for_two/
baerchen201,"How to remove ""Whats New"" in the Steam Library",4,2024-05-12 07:59:25+00:00,"Today I found a way to remove the (imo annoying) What's new section in the Steam library.

So I decided to make a tutorial (since the process of doing this is quite complicated).

Step 0: Make sure you have permission by the Computer owner to do this. This will modify Steam client files for all users, on the other hand any user not setting their Steam shortcuts correctly will undo your work (Step 12).

Step 1: Exit Steam completely.

Step 2: Press the Windows key and R. A Box saying ""Run"" should open. If you don't have a Windows key, just open the Start menu and type ""Run"", then open the (in most cases) first result.  
Type `cmd` and press Enter. A command prompt should open.

Step 3: Use the command prompt to navigate to your Steam folder (*C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam*).  
You can do this by typing `cd ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam""` (*cd* = Change directory)  
If you have multiple systems installed, make sure to replace drive C with your actual system drive.

Step 4: Start steam in debug mode.  
Type `.\steam.exe -dev`. This starts the steam client in debug mode and allows you to use *Inspect Element* on it.

Step 5: Go to the Library. When you see the ""What's new"" section, hold shift on your keyboard and right click its background (Anywhere that's not red on the following image). Then select `Inspect Element`

[Step 5](https://preview.redd.it/llab5urjzxzc1.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cbee8118d9a2c2db37282b278256af79d331e29)

Step 6: After the developer tools open, there should be a `<div class=""something"">` object selected:

[Step 6](https://preview.redd.it/9ebecfp20yzc1.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ffb06b08ac83bed72fd823f864998853a02a0a1)

Step 7 (getting complicated now): For this step, make sure you can see both the steam client and the developer tools window.  
Now, hover your mouse over the selected div element. A blue box should appear in the client. This indicates what element that div actually is.  
Now, hover your mouse up the hierarchy **until the only thing selected by the blue box is the What's new section and the element (most likely also a div) has a class**.  
I even made a short video tutorial: [https://youtu.be/CXwDGmtkXfM](https://youtu.be/CXwDGmtkXfM)

Step 8: Modifying the files to hide it permanently  
Open the file explorer and navigate to the *css* folder in your steam install directory (*C: -> Program Files (x86) -> Steam -> steamui -> css*).

Step 9: Find the class in the files.  
Open each of the *CSS source* files in a text editor (like notepad) and search for a dot + the class name you copied (in the case of the video tutorial `._17uEBe5Ri8TMsnfELvs8-N`).  
When it finds something, proceed to step 10

Step 10: It will probably find more than one result, so you have to find the appropriate class styles. It should start with something like this: `._17uEBe5Ri8TMsnfELvs8-N{`

[Step 10](https://preview.redd.it/ofjy4ry29yzc1.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4cf45586e9d4a2027ddfc6baab498e539d5f291)

Step 11: To actually add the code, just paste `display:none;` after the ""{"". This just hides the element.

Done...?  
No. Upon restart, Steam will verify its files, notice something is wrong and download the original from its servers. To prevent that, do the following:

Step 12: 

* If you use a desktop shortcut: 
   1. Right click the shortcut
   2. Open the properties
   3. Find the *Target*
   4. Add  `-noverifyfiles` at the end (it should become something like `""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe"" -noverifyfiles`)
   5. Click OK and allow modifying the protected file
* If you use a start menu/taskbar shortcut:
   1. Open the start menu
   2. Search for ""Steam""
   3. Right click steam and open the file location
   4. Right click the shortcut it shows you in the file explorer and open its properties
   5. Repeat step 3+ from the desktop shortcut instructions above
   6. Remove the taskbar/start menu shortcut links
   7. Add them back by searching for ""Steam"", right clicking steam and pinning it to start or taskbar

Done. Now the ""What's new"" section should be hidden permanently.  
If it doesn't work for you, make sure you're not using the beta client.  
This tutorial was created on steam version 1714854927, you can check your version by opening steam, pressing ""Help"" on the title bar and selecting ""About"".

Steam updating will also verify the files, so you'll have to repeat this process.

Questioning-Warrior,Would the PC port of Ghost of Tsushima be relisted IF the PSN was dropped (or at least made an option)?,46,2024-05-11 22:15:57+00:00,"It absolutely sucks for everyone that just a few days before the PC was to be launched, over 100 countries delighted the game when it was found out to require a PSN account to play for multi-player. While I'm lucky to still have the game available, it will surely be a lose-lose situation for everyone. Less people will play, the people who worked hard on the port will have their work wasted, and Sony will lose so much money after losing many countries that would sell as well as hurting their customer base.

One thing I wonder, though, is what would happen if they dropped the PSN account entirely, or at least make it an option if you wish to cross play (you can still play with other PC players without the account), before or after the game launches. Would the countries bring the game back?

It's absolutely depressing that such a hyped port has been greatly hurt just a few days before release just because a controversial business decision was made that could have easily been avoided...",https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1cpsony/would_the_pc_port_of_ghost_of_tsushima_be/
